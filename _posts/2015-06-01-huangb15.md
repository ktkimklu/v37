title: Deterministic Independent Component Analysis
abstract: We study independent component analysis with noisy observations. We present,
  for the first time in the literature, consistent, polynomial-time algorithms to
  recover non-Gaussian source signals and the mixing matrix with a reconstruction
  error that vanishes at a 1/\sqrtT rate using T observations and scales only polynomially
  with the natural parameters of the problem. Our algorithms and analysis also extend
  to deterministic source signals whose empirical distributions are approximately
  independent.
