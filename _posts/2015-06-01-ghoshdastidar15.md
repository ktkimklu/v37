title: A Provable Generalized Tensor Spectral Method for Uniform Hypergraph Partitioning
abstract: Matrix spectral methods play an important role in statistics and machine
  learning, and most often the word ‘matrix’ is dropped as, by default, one assumes
  that similarities or affinities are measured between two points, thereby resulting
  in similarity matrices. However, recent challenges in computer vision and text mining
  have necessitated the use of multi-way affinities in the learning methods, and this
  has led to a considerable interest in hypergraph partitioning methods in machine
  learning community. A plethora of “higher-order” algorithms have been proposed in
  the past decade, but their theoretical guarantees are not well-studied. In this
  paper, we develop a unified approach for partitioning uniform hypergraphs by means
  of a tensor trace optimization problem involving the affinity tensor, and a number
  of existing higher-order methods turn out to be special cases of the proposed formulation.
  We further propose an algorithm to solve the proposed trace optimization problem,
  and prove that it is consistent under a planted hypergraph model. We also provide
  experimental results to validate our theoretical findings.
