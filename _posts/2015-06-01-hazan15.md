title: Classification with Low Rank and Missing Data
abstract: We consider classification and regression tasks where we have missing data
  and assume that the (clean) data resides in a low rank subspace. Finding a hidden
  subspace is known to be computationally hard. Nevertheless, using a non-proper formulation
  we give an efficient agnostic algorithm that classifies as good as the best linear
  classifier coupled with the best low-dimensional subspace in which the data resides.
  A direct implication is that our algorithm can linearly (and non-linearly through
  kernels) classify provably as well as the best classifier that has access to the
  full data.
