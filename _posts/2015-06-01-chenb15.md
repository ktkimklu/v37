title: Learning Deep Structured Models
abstract: Many problems in real-world applications involve predicting several random
  variables that are statistically related. Markov random fields (MRFs) are a great
  mathematical tool to encode such dependencies. The goal of this paper is to combine
  MRFs with deep learning to estimate complex representations while taking into account
  the dependencies between the output random variables. Towards this goal, we propose
  a training algorithm that is able to learn structured models jointly with deep features
  that form the MRF potentials. Our approach is efficient as it blends learning and
  inference and makes use of GPU acceleration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
  our algorithm in the tasks of predicting words from noisy images, as well as tagging
  of Flickr photographs. We show that joint learning of the deep features and the
  MRF parameters results in significant performance gains.
