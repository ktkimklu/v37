title: Active Nearest Neighbors in Changing Environments
abstract: While classic machine learning paradigms assume training and test data are
  generated from the same process, domain adaptation addresses the more realistic
  setting in which the learner has large quantities of labeled data from some source
  task but limited or no labeled data from the target task it is attempting to learn.
  In this work, we give the first formal analysis showing that using active learning
  for domain adaptation yields a way to address the statistical challenges inherent
  in this setting. We propose a novel nonparametric algorithm, ANDA, that combines
  an active nearest neighbor querying strategy with nearest neighbor prediction. We
  provide analyses of its querying behavior and of finite sample convergence rates
  of the resulting classifier under covariate shift. Our experiments show that ANDA
  successfully corrects for dataset bias in multi-class image categorization.
