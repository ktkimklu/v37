title: Algorithms for the Hard Pre-Image Problem of String Kernels and the General
  Problem of String Prediction
abstract: We address the pre-image problem encountered in structured output prediction
  and the one of finding a string maximizing the prediction function of various kernel-based
  classifiers and regressors. We demonstrate that these problems reduce to a common
  combinatorial problem valid for many string kernels. For this problem, we propose
  an upper bound on the prediction function which has low computational complexity
  and which can be used in a branch and bound search algorithm to obtain optimal solutions.
  We also show that for many string kernels, the complexity of the problem increases
  significantly when the kernel is normalized. On the optical word recognition task,
  the exact solution of the pre-image problem is shown to significantly improve the
  prediction accuracy in comparison with an approximation found by the best known
  heuristic. On the task of finding a string maximizing the prediction function of
  kernel-based classifiers and regressors, we highlight that existing methods can
  be biased toward long strings that contain many repeated symbols. We demonstrate
  that this bias is removed when using normalized kernels. Finally, we present results
  for the discovery of lead compounds in drug discovery. The source code can be found
