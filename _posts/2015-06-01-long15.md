title: Learning Transferable Features with Deep Adaptation Networks
abstract: Recent studies reveal that a deep neural network can learn transferable
  features which generalize well to novel tasks for domain adaptation. However, as
  deep features eventually transition from general to specific along the network,
  the feature transferability drops significantly in higher layers with increasing
  domain discrepancy. Hence, it is important to formally reduce the dataset bias and
  enhance the transferability in task-specific layers. In this paper, we propose a
  new Deep Adaptation Network (DAN) architecture, which generalizes deep convolutional
  neural network to the domain adaptation scenario. In DAN, hidden representations
  of all task-specific layers are embedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space where
  the mean embeddings of different domain distributions can be explicitly matched.
  The domain discrepancy is further reduced using an optimal multi-kernel selection
  method for mean embedding matching. DAN can learn transferable features with statistical
  guarantees, and can scale linearly by unbiased estimate of kernel embedding. Extensive
  empirical evidence shows that the proposed architecture yields state-of-the-art
  image classification error rates on standard domain adaptation benchmarks.
