title: 'Budget Allocation Problem with Multiple Advertisers: A Game Theoretic View'
abstract: In marketing planning, advertisers seek to maximize the number of customers
  by allocating given budgets to each media channel effectively. The budget allocation
  problem with a bipartite influence model captures this scenario; however, the model
  is problematic because it assumes there is only one advertiser in the market. In
  reality, there are many advertisers which are in conflict of advertisement; thus
  we must extend the model for such a case. By extending the budget allocation problem
  with a bipartite influence model, we propose a game-theoretic model problem that
  considers many advertisers. By simulating our model, we can analyze the behavior
  of a media channel market, e.g., we can estimate which media channels are allocated
  by an advertiser, and which customers are influenced by an advertiser. Our model
  has many attractive features. First, our model is a potential game; therefore, it
  has a pure Nash equilibrium. Second, any Nash equilibrium of our game has 2-optimal
  social utility, i.e., the price of anarchy is 2. Finally, the proposed model can
  be simulated very efficiently; thus it can be used to analyze large markets.
