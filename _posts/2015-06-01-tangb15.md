title: Learning Scale-Free Networks by Dynamic Node Specific Degree Prior
abstract: Learning network structure underlying data is an important problem in machine
  learning. This paper presents a novel degree prior to study the inference of scale-free
  networks, which are widely used to model social and biological networks. In particular,
  this paper formulates scale-free network inference using Gaussian Graphical model
  (GGM) regularized by a node degree prior. Our degree prior not only promotes a desirable
  global degree distribution, but also exploits the estimated degree of an individual
  node and the relative strength of all the edges of a single node. To fulfill this,
  this paper proposes a ranking-based method to dynamically estimate the degree of
  a node, which makes the resultant optimization problem challenging to solve. To
  deal with this, this paper presents a novel ADMM (alternating direction method of
  multipliers) procedure. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real data
  show that our prior not only yields a scale-free network, but also produces many
  more correctly predicted edges than existing scale-free inducing prior, hub-inducing
  prior and the l_1 norm.
