title: Scalable Bayesian Optimization Using Deep Neural Networks
abstract: Bayesian optimization is an effective methodology for the global optimization
  of functions with expensive evaluations. It relies on querying a distribution over
  functions defined by a relatively cheap surrogate model. An accurate model for this
  distribution over functions is critical to the effectiveness of the approach, and
  is typically fit using Gaussian processes (GPs). However, since GPs scale cubically
  with the number of observations, it has been challenging to handle objectives whose
  optimization requires many evaluations, and as such, massively parallelizing the
  optimization. In this work, we explore the use of neural networks as an alternative
  to GPs to model distributions over functions. We show that performing adaptive basis
  function regression with a neural network as the parametric form performs competitively
  with state-of-the-art GP-based approaches, but scales linearly with the number of
  data rather than cubically. This allows us to achieve a previously intractable degree
  of parallelism, which we apply to large scale hyperparameter optimization, rapidly
  finding competitive models on benchmark object recognition tasks using convolutional
  networks, and image caption generation using neural language models.
