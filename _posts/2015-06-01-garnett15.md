title: Finding Galaxies in the Shadows of Quasars with Gaussian Processes
abstract: We develop an automated technique for detecting damped Lyman-αabsorbers
  (DLAs) along spectroscopic sightlines to quasi-stellar objects (QSOs or quasars).
  The detection of DLAs in large-scale spectroscopic surveys such as SDSS–III is critical
  to address outstanding cosmological questions, such as the nature of galaxy formation.
  We use nearly 50000 QSO spectra to learn a tailored Gaussian process model for quasar
  emission spectra, which we apply to the DLA detection problem via Bayesian model
  selection. We demonstrate our method’s effectiveness with a large-scale validation
  experiment on over 100000 spectra, with excellent performance.
