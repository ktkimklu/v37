title: Learning from Corrupted Binary Labels via Class-Probability Estimation
abstract: Many supervised learning problems involve learning from samples whose labels
  are corrupted in some way. For example, each sample may have some constant probability
  of being incorrectly labelled (learning with label noise), or one may have a pool
  of unlabelled samples in lieu of negative samples (learning from positive and unlabelled
  data). This paper uses class-probability estimation to study these and other corruption
  processes belonging to the mutually contaminated distributions framework (Scott
  et al., 2013), with three conclusions. First, one can optimise balanced error and
  AUC without knowledge of the corruption process parameters. Second, given estimates
  of the corruption parameters, one can minimise a range of classification risks.
  Third, one can estimate the corruption parameters using only corrupted data. Experiments
  confirm the efficacy of class-probability estimation in learning from corrupted
  labels.
