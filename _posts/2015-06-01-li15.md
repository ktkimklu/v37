title: Generative Moment Matching Networks
abstract: We consider the problem of learning deep generative models from data. We
  formulate a method that generates an independent sample via a single feedforward
  pass through a multilayer preceptron, as in the recently proposed generative adversarial
  networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Training a generative adversarial network, however,
  requires careful optimization of a difficult minimax program. Instead, we utilize
  a technique from statistical hypothesis testing known as maximum mean discrepancy
  (MMD), which leads to a simple objective that can be interpreted as matching all
  orders of statistics between a dataset and samples from the model, and can be trained
  by backpropagation. We further boost the performance of this approach by combining
  our generative network with an auto-encoder network, using MMD to learn to generate
  codes that can then be decoded to produce samples. We show that the combination
  of these techniques yields excellent generative models compared to baseline approaches
  as measured on MNIST and the Toronto Face Database.
