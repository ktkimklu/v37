title: Scalable Nonparametric Bayesian Inference on Point Processes with Gaussian
  Processes
abstract: In this paper we propose an efficient, scalable non-parametric Gaussian
  process model for inference on Poisson point processes. Our model does not resort
  to gridding the domain or to introducing latent thinning points. Unlike competing
  models that scale as O(n^3) over n data points, our model has a complexity O(nk^2)
  where k << n. We propose a MCMC sampler and show that the model obtained is faster,
  more accurate and generates less correlated samples than competing approaches on
  both synthetic and real-life data. Finally, we show that our model easily handles
  data sizes not considered thus far by alternate approaches.
