title: Robust Estimation of Transition Matrices in High Dimensional Heavy-tailed Vector
  Autoregressive Processes
abstract: Gaussian vector autoregressive (VAR) processes have been extensively studied
  in the literature. However, Gaussian assumptions are stringent for heavy-tailed
  time series that frequently arises in finance and economics. In this paper, we develop
  a unified framework for modeling and estimating heavy-tailed VAR processes. In particular,
  we generalize the Gaussian VAR model by an elliptical VAR model that naturally accommodates
  heavy-tailed time series. Under this model, we develop a quantile-based robust estimator
  for the transition matrix of the VAR process. We show that the proposed estimator
  achieves parametric rates of convergence in high dimensions. This is the first work
  in analyzing heavy-tailed high dimensional VAR processes. As an application of the
  proposed framework, we investigate Granger causality in the elliptical VAR process,
  and show that the robust transition matrix estimator induces sign-consistent estimators
  of Granger causality. The empirical performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated
  by both synthetic and real data. We show that the proposed estimator is robust to
  heavy tails, and exhibit superior performance in stock price prediction.
