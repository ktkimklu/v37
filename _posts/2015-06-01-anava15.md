title: Online Time Series Prediction with Missing Data
abstract: We consider the problem of time series prediction in the presence of missing
  data. We cast the problem as an online learning problem in which the goal of the
  learner is to minimize prediction error. We then devise an efficient algorithm for
  the problem, which is based on autoregressive model, and does not assume any structure
  on the missing data nor on the mechanism that generates the time series. We show
  that our algorithmâ€™s performance asymptotically approaches the performance of the
  best AR predictor in hindsight, and corroborate the theoretic results with an empirical
  study on synthetic and real-world data.
