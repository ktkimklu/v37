title: Strongly Adaptive Online Learning
abstract: Strongly adaptive algorithms are algorithms whose performance on every time
  interval is close to optimal. We present a reduction that can transform standard
  low-regret algorithms to strongly adaptive. As a consequence, we derive simple,
  yet efficient, strongly adaptive algorithms for a handful of problems.
