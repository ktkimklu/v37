title: Metadata Dependent Mondrian Processes
abstract: Stochastic partition processes in a product space play an important role
  in modeling relational data. Recent studies on the Mondrian process have introduced
  more flexibility into the block structure in relational models. A side-effect of
  such high flexibility is that, in data sparsity scenarios, the model is prone to
  overfit. In reality, relational entities are always associated with meta information,
  such as user profiles in a social network. In this paper, we propose a metadata
  dependent Mondrian process (MDMP) to incorporate meta information into the stochastic
  partition process in the product space and the entity allocation process on the
  resulting block structure. MDMP can not only encourage homogeneous relational interactions
  within blocks but also discourage meta-label diversity within blocks. Regularized
  by meta information, MDMP becomes more robust in data sparsity scenarios and easier
  to converge in posterior inference. We apply MDMP to link prediction and rating
  prediction and demonstrate that MDMP is more effective than the baseline models
  in prediction accuracy with a more parsimonious model structure.
