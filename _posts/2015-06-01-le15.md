title: Unsupervised Riemannian Metric Learning for Histograms Using Aitchison Transformations
abstract: Many applications in machine learning handle bags of features or histograms
  rather than simple vectors. In that context, defining a proper geometry to compare
  histograms can be crucial for many machine learning algorithms. While one might
  be tempted to use a default metric such as the Euclidean metric, empirical evidence
  shows this may not be the best choice when dealing with observations that lie in
  the probability simplex. Additionally, it might be desirable to choose a metric
  adaptively based on data. We consider in this paper the problem of learning a Riemannian
  metric on the simplex given unlabeled histogram data. We follow the approach of
  Lebanon(2006), who proposed to estimate such a metric within a parametric family
  by maximizing the inverse volume of a given data set of points under that metric.
  The metrics we consider on the multinomial simplex are pull-back metrics of the
  Fisher information parameterized by operations within the simplex known as Aitchison(1982)
  transformations. We propose an algorithmic approach to maximize inverse volumes
  using sampling and contrastive divergences. We provide experimental evidence that
  the metric obtained under our proposal outperforms alternative approaches.
