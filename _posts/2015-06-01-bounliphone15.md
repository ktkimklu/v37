title: A low variance consistent test of relative dependency
abstract: 'We describe a novel non-parametric statistical hypothesis test of relative
  dependence between a source variable and two candidate target variables. Such a
  test enables us to determine whether one source variable is significantly more dependent
  on a first target variable or a second. Dependence is measured via the Hilbert-Schmidt
  Independence Criterion (HSIC), resulting in a pair of empirical dependence measures
  (source-target 1, source-target 2). We test whether the first dependence measure
  is significantly larger than the second. Modeling the covariance between these HSIC
  statistics leads to a provably more powerful test than the construction of independent
  HSIC statistics by sub-sampling. The resulting test is consistent and unbiased,
  and (being based on U-statistics) has favorable convergence properties. The test
  can be computed in quadratic time, matching the computational complexity of standard
  empirical HSIC estimators. The effectiveness of the test is demonstrated on several
  real-world problems: we identify language groups from a multilingual corpus, and
  we prove that tumor location is more dependent on gene expression than chromosomal
  imbalances. Source code is available for download at https://github.com/wbounliphone/reldep/.'
