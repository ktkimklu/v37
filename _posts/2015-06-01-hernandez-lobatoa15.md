title: A Probabilistic Model for Dirty Multi-task Feature Selection
abstract: Multi-task feature selection methods often make the hypothesis that learning
  tasks share relevant and irrelevant features. However, this hypothesis may be too
  restrictive in practice. For example, there may be a few tasks with specific relevant
  and irrelevant features (outlier tasks). Similarly, a few of the features may be
  relevant for only some of the tasks (outlier features). To account for this, we
  propose a model for multi-task feature selection based on a robust prior distribution
  that introduces a set of binary latent variables to identify outlier tasks and outlier
  features. Expectation propagation can be used for efficient approximate inference
  under the proposed prior. Several experiments show that a model based on the new
  robust prior provides better predictive performance than other benchmark methods.
