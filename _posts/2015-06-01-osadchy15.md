title: K-hyperplane Hinge-Minimax Classifier
abstract: We explore a novel approach to upper bound the misclassification error for
  problems with data comprising a small number of positive samples and a large number
  of negative samples. We assign the hinge-loss to upper bound the misclassification
  error of the positive examples and use the minimax risk to upper bound the misclassification
  error with respect to the worst case distribution that generates the negative examples.
  This approach is computationally appealing since the majority of training examples
  (belonging to the negative class) are represented by the statistics of their distribution,
  in contrast to kernel SVM which produces a very large number of support vectors
  in such settings. We derive empirical risk bounds for linear and non-linear classification
  and show that they are dimensionally independent and decay as 1/\sqrtm for m samples.
  We propose an efficient algorithm for training an intersection of finite number
  of hyperplane and demonstrate its effectiveness on real data, including letter and
  scene recognition.
