title: Information Geometry and Minimum Description Length Networks
abstract: We study parametric unsupervised mixture learning. We measure the loss of
  intrinsic information from the observations to complex mixture models, and then
  to simple mixture models. We present a geometric picture, where all these representations
  are regarded as free points in the space of probability distributions. Based on
  minimum description length, we derive a simple geometric principle to learn all
  these models together. We present a new learning machine with theories, algorithms,
  and simulations.
