title: 'The Ladder: A Reliable Leaderboard for Machine Learning Competitions'
abstract: The organizer of a machine learning competition faces the problem of maintaining
  an accurate leaderboard that faithfully represents the quality of the best submission
  of each competing team. What makes this estimation problem particularly challenging
  is its sequential and adaptive nature. As participants are allowed to repeatedly
  evaluate their submissions on the leaderboard, they may begin to overfit to the
  holdout data that supports the leaderboard. Few theoretical results give actionable
  advice on how to design a reliable leaderboard. Existing approaches therefore often
  resort to poorly understood heuristics such as limiting the bit precision of answers
  and the rate of re-submission. In this work, we introduce a notion of leaderboard
  accuracy tailored to the format of a competition. We introduce a natural algorithm
  called the Ladder and demonstrate that it simultaneously supports strong theoretical
  guarantees in a fully adaptive model of estimation, withstands practical adversarial
  attacks, and achieves high utility on real submission files from a Kaggle competition.
  Notably, we are able to sidestep a powerful recent hardness result for adaptive
  risk estimation that rules out algorithms such as ours under a seemingly very similar
  notion of accuracy. On a practical note, we provide a completely parameter-free
  variant of our algorithm that can be deployed in a real competition with no tuning
  required whatsoever.
