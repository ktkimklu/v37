title: The Fundamental Incompatibility of Scalable Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Naive
  Data Subsampling
abstract: Leveraging the coherent exploration of Hamiltonian flow, Hamiltonian Monte
  Carlo produces computationally efficient Monte Carlo estimators, even with respect
  to complex and high-dimensional target distributions. When confronted with data-intensive
  applications, however, the algorithm may be too expensive to implement, leaving
  us to consider the utility of approximations such as data subsampling. In this paper
  I demonstrate how data subsampling fundamentally compromises the scalability of
  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
