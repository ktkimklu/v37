title: Distributed Inference for Dirichlet Process Mixture Models
abstract: Bayesian nonparametric mixture models based on the Dirichlet process (DP)
  have been widely used for solving problems like clustering, density estimation and
  topic modelling. These models make weak assumptions about the underlying process
  that generated the observed data. Thus, when more data are collected, the complexity
  of these models can change accordingly. These theoretical properties often lead
  to superior predictive performance when compared to traditional finite mixture models.
  However, despite the increasing amount of data available, the application of Bayesian
  nonparametric mixture models is so far limited to relatively small data sets. In
  this paper, we propose an efficient distributed inference algorithm for the DP and
  the HDP mixture model. The proposed method is based on a variant of the slice sampler
  for DPs. Since this sampler does not involve a pre-determined truncation, the stationary
  distribution of the sampling algorithm is unbiased. We provide both local thread-level
  and distributed machine-level parallel implementations and study the performance
  of this sampler through an extensive set of experiments on image and text data.
  When compared to existing inference algorithms, the proposed method exhibits state-of-the-art
  accuracy and strong scalability with up to 512 cores.
