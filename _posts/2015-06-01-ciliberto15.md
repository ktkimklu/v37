title: Convex Learning of Multiple Tasks and their Structure
abstract: Reducing the amount of human supervision is a key problem in machine learning
  and a natural approach is that of exploiting the relations (structure) among different
  tasks. This is the idea at the core of multi-task learning. In this context a fundamental
  question is how to incorporate the tasks structure in the learning problem. We tackle
  this question by studying a general computational framework that allows to encode
  a-priori knowledge of the tasks structure in the form of a convex penalty; in this
  setting a variety of previously proposed methods can be recovered as special cases,
  including linear and non-linear approaches. Within this framework, we show that
  tasks and their structure can be efficiently learned considering a convex optimization
  problem that can be approached by means of block coordinate methods such as alternating
  minimization and for which we prove convergence to the global minimum.
