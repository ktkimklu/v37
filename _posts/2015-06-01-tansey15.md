title: Vector-Space Markov Random Fields via Exponential Families
abstract: We present Vector-Space Markov Random Fields (VS-MRFs), a novel class of
  undirected graphical models where each variable can belong to an arbitrary vector
  space. VS-MRFs generalize a recent line of work on scalar-valued, uni-parameter
  exponential family and mixed graphical models, thereby greatly broadening the class
  of exponential families available (e.g., allowing multinomial and Dirichlet distributions).
  Specifically, VS-MRFs are the joint graphical model distributions where the node-conditional
  distributions belong to generic exponential families with general vector space domains.
  We also present a sparsistent M-estimator for learning our class of MRFs that recovers
  the correct set of edges with high probability. We validate our approach via a set
  of synthetic data experiments as well as a real-world case study of over four million
  foods from the popular diet tracking app MyFitnessPal. Our results demonstrate that
  our algorithm performs well empirically and that VS-MRFs are capable of capturing
  and highlighting interesting structure in complex, real-world data. All code for
  our algorithm is open source and publicly available.
