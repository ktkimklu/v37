title: An embarrassingly simple approach to zero-shot learning
abstract: Zero-shot learning consists in learning how to recognize new concepts by
  just having a description of them. Many sophisticated approaches have been proposed
  to address the challenges this problem comprises. In this paper we describe a zero-shot
  learning approach that can be implemented in just one line of code, yet it is able
  to outperform state of the art approaches on standard datasets. The approach is
  based on a more general framework which models the relationships between features,
  attributes, and classes as a two linear layers network, where the weights of the
  top layer are not learned but are given by the environment. We further provide a
  learning bound on the generalization error of this kind of approaches, by casting
  them as domain adaptation methods. In experiments carried out on three standard
  real datasets, we found that our approach is able to perform significantly better
  than the state of art on all of them, obtaining a ratio of improvement up to 17%.
