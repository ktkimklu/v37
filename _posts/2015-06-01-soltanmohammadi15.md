title: Context-based Unsupervised Data Fusion for Decision Making
abstract: Big Data received from sources such as social media, in-stream monitoring
  systems, networks, and markets is often mined for discovering patterns, detecting
  anomalies, and making decisions or predictions. In distributed learning and real-time
  processing of Big Data, ensemble-based systems in which a fusion center (FC) is
  used to combine the local decisions of several classifiers, have shown to be superior
  to single expert systems. However, optimal design of the FC requires knowledge of
  the accuracy of the individual classifiers which, in many cases, is not available.
  Moreover, in many applications supervised training of the FC is not feasible since
  the true labels of the data set are not available. In this paper, we propose an
  unsupervised joint estimation-detection scheme to estimate the accuracies of the
  local classifiers as functions of data context and to fuse the local decisions of
  the classifiers. Numerical results show the dramatic improvement of the proposed
  method as compared with the state of the art approaches.
