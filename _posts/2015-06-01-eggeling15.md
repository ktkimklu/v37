title: 'Dealing with small data: On the generalization of context trees'
abstract: Context trees (CT) are a widely used tool in machine learning for representing
  context-specific independences in conditional probability distributions. Parsimonious
  context trees (PCTs) are a recently proposed generalization of CTs that can enable
  statistically more efficient learning due to a higher structural flexibility, which
  is particularly useful for small-data settings. However, this comes at the cost
  of a computationally expensive structure learning algorithm, which is feasible only
  for domains with small alphabets and tree depths. In this work, we investigate to
  which degree CTs can be generalized to increase statistical efficiency while still
  keeping the learning computationally feasible. Approaching this goal from two different
  angles, we (i) propose algorithmic improvements to the PCT learning algorithm, and
  (ii) study further generalizations of CTs, which are inspired by PCTs, but trade
  structural flexibility for computational efficiency. By empirical studies both on
  simulated and real-world data, we demonstrate that the synergy of combining of both
  orthogonal approaches yields a substantial improvement in obtaining statistically
  efficient and computationally feasible generalizations of CTs.
