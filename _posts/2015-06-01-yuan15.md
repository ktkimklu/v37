title: Non-Gaussian Discriminative Factor Models via the Max-Margin Rank-Likelihood
abstract: We consider the problem of discriminative factor analysis for data that
  are in general non-Gaussian. A Bayesian model based on the ranks of the data is
  proposed. We first introduce a max-margin version of the rank-likelihood. A discriminative
  factor model is then developed, integrating the new max-margin rank-likelihood and
  (linear) Bayesian support vector machines, which are also built on the max-margin
  principle. The discriminative factor model is further extended to the nonlinear
  case through mixtures of local linear classifiers, via Dirichlet processes. Fully
  local conjugacy of the model yields efficient inference with both Markov Chain Monte
  Carlo and variational Bayes approaches. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real
  data demonstrate superior performance of the proposed model and its potential for
  applications in computational biology.
