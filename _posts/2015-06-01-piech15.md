title: Learning Program Embeddings to Propagate Feedback on Student Code
abstract: Providing feedback, both assessing final work and giving hints to stuck
  students, is difficult for open-ended assignments in massive online classes which
  can range from thousands to millions of students. We introduce a neural network
  method to encode programs as a linear mapping from an embedded precondition space
  to an embedded postcondition space and propose an algorithm for feedback at scale
  using these linear maps as features. We apply our algorithm to assessments from
  the Code.org Hour of Code and Stanford Universityâ€™s CS1 course, where we propagate
  human comments on student assignments to orders of magnitude more submissions.
