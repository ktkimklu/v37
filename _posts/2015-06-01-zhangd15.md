title: Markov Mixed Membership Models
abstract: We present a Markov mixed membership model (Markov M3) for grouped data
  that learns a fully connected graph structure among mixing components. A key feature
  of Markov M3 is that it interprets the mixed membership assignment as a Markov random
  walk over this graph of nodes. This is in contrast to tree-structured models in
  which the assignment is done according to a tree structure on the mixing components.
  The Markov structure results in a simple parametric model that can learn a complex
  dependency structure between nodes, while still maintaining full conjugacy for closed-form
  stochastic variational inference. Empirical results demonstrate that Markov M3 performs
  well compared with tree structured topic models, and can learn meaningful dependency
  structure between topics.
