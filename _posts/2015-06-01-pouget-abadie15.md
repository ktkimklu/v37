title: 'Inferring Graphs from Cascades: A Sparse Recovery Framework'
abstract: In the Graph Inference problem, one seeks to recover the edges of an unknown
  graph from the observations of cascades propagating over this graph. In this paper,
  we approach this problem from the sparse recovery perspective. We introduce a general
  model of cascades, including the voter model and the independent cascade model,
  for which we provide the first algorithm which recovers the graph’s edges with high
  probability and O(s log m) measurements where s is the maximum degree of the graph
  and m is the number of nodes. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm also recovers
  the edge weights (the parameters of the diffusion process) and is robust in the
  context of approximate sparsity. Finally we prove an almost matching lower bound
  of Ω(s \log m/s) and validate our approach empirically on synthetic graphs.
