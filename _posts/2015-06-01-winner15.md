title: Inference in a Partially Observed Queuing Model with Applications in Ecology
abstract: We consider the problem of inference in a probabilistic model for transient
  populations where we wish to learn about arrivals, departures, and population size
  over all time, but the only available data are periodic counts of the population
  size at specific observation times. The underlying model arises in queueing theory
  (as an M/G/inf queue) and also in ecological models for short-lived animals such
  as insects. Our work applies to both systems. Previous work in the ecology literature
  focused on maximum likelihood estimation and made a simplifying independence assumption
  that prevents inference over unobserved random variables such as arrivals and departures.
  The contribution of this paper is to formulate a latent variable model and develop
  a novel Gibbs sampler based on Markov bases to perform inference using the correct,
  but intractable, likelihood function. We empirically validate the convergence behavior
  of our sampler and demonstrate the ability of our model to make much finer-grained
  inferences than the previous approach.
