title: Telling cause from effect in deterministic linear dynamical systems
abstract: Telling a cause from its effect using observed time series data is a major
  challenge in natural and social sciences. Assuming the effect is generated by the
  cause through a linear system, we propose a new approach based on the hypothesis
  that nature chooses the “cause” and the “mechanism generating the effect from the
  cause” independently of each other. Specifically we postulate that the power spectrum
  of the “cause” time series is uncorrelated with the square of the frequency response
  of the linear filter (system) generating the effect. While most causal discovery
  methods for time series mainly rely on the noise, our method relies on asymmetries
  of the power spectral density properties that exist even in deterministic systems.
  We describe mathematical assumptions in a deterministic model under which the causal
  direction is identifiable. In particular, we show a scenario where the method works
  but Granger causality fails. Experiments show encouraging results on synthetic as
  well as real-world data. Overall, this suggests that the postulate of Independence
  of Cause and Mechanism is a promising principle for causal inference on observed
  time series.
