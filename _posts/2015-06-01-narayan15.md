title: Alpha-Beta Divergences Discover Micro and Macro Structures in Data
abstract: 'Although recent work in non-linear dimensionality reduction investigates
  multiple choices of divergence measure during optimization \citeyang2013icml,bunte2012neuro,
  little work discusses the direct effects that divergence measures have on visualization.
  We study this relationship, theoretically and through an empirical analysis over
  10 datasets. Our works shows how the αand βparameters of the generalized alpha-beta
  divergence can be chosen to discover hidden macro-structures (categories, e.g. birds)
  or micro-structures (fine-grained classes, e.g. toucans). Our method, which generalizes
  t-SNE \citetsne, allows us to discover such structure without extensive grid searches
  over (α, β) due to our theoretical analysis: such structure is apparent with particular
  choices of (α, β) that generalize across datasets. We also discuss efficient parallel
  CPU and GPU schemes which are non-trivial due to the tree-structures employed in
  optimization and the large datasets that do not fully fit into GPU memory. Our method
  runs 20x faster than the fastest published code \citefmm. We conclude with detailed
  case studies on the following very large datasets: ILSVRC 2012, a standard computer
  vision dataset with 1.2M images; SUSY, a particle physics dataset with 5M instances;
  and HIGGS, another particle physics dataset with 11M instances. This represents
  the largest published visualization attained by SNE methods. We have open-sourced
  our visualization code: \texttthttp://rll.berkeley.edu/absne/.'
