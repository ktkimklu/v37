title: How Hard is Inference for Structured Prediction?
abstract: Structured prediction tasks in machine learning involve the simultaneous
  prediction of multiple labels. This is often done by maximizing a score function
  on the space of labels, which decomposes as a sum of pairwise elements, each depending
  on two specific labels. The goal of this paper is to develop a theoretical explanation
  of the empirical effectiveness of heuristic inference algorithms for solving such
  structured prediction problems. We study the minimum-achievable expected Hamming
  error in such problems, highlighting the case of 2D grid graphs, which are common
  in machine vision applications. Our main theorems provide tight upper and lower
  bounds on this error, as well as a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the bound.
