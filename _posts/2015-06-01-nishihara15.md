title: A General Analysis of the Convergence of ADMM
abstract: We provide a new proof of the linear convergence of the alternating direction
  method of multipliers (ADMM) when one of the objective terms is strongly convex.
  Our proof is based on a framework for analyzing optimization algorithms introduced
  in Lessard et al. (2014), reducing algorithm convergence to verifying the stability
  of a dynamical system. This approach generalizes a number of existing results and
  obviates any assumptions about specific choices of algorithm parameters. On a numerical
  example, we demonstrate that minimizing the derived bound on the convergence rate
  provides a practical approach to selecting algorithm parameters for particular ADMM
  instances. We complement our upper bound by constructing a nearly-matching lower
  bound on the worst-case rate of convergence.
