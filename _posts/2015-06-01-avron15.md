title: Community Detection Using Time-Dependent Personalized PageRank
abstract: Local graph diffusions have proven to be valuable tools for solving various
  graph clustering problems. As such, there has been much interest recently in efficient
  local algorithms for computing them. We present an efficient local algorithm for
  approximating a graph diffusion that generalizes both the celebrated personalized
  PageRank and its recent competitor/companion - the heat kernel. Our algorithm is
  based on writing the diffusion vector as the solution of an initial value problem,
  and then using a waveform relaxation approach to approximate the solution. Our experimental
  results suggest that it produces rankings that are distinct and competitive with
  the ones produced by high quality implementations of personalized PageRank and localized
  heat kernel, and that our algorithm is a useful addition to the toolset of localized
  graph diffusions.
