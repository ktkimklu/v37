title: 'Rebuilding Factorized Information Criterion: Asymptotically Accurate Marginal
  Likelihood'
abstract: Factorized information criterion (FIC) is a recently developed approximation
  technique for the marginal log-likelihood, which provides an automatic model selection
  framework for a few latent variable models (LVMs) with tractable inference algorithms.
  This paper reconsiders FIC and fills theoretical gaps of previous FIC studies. First,
  we reveal the core idea of FIC that allows generalization for a broader class of
  LVMs, including continuous LVMs, in contrast to previous FICs, which are applicable
  only to binary LVMs. Second, we investigate the model selection mechanism of the
  generalized FIC. Our analysis provides a formal justification of FIC as a model
  selection criterion for LVMs and also a systematic procedure for pruning redundant
  latent variables that have been removed heuristically in previous studies. Third,
  we provide an interpretation of FIC as a variational free energy and uncover previously-unknown
  their relationship. A demonstrative study on Bayesian principal component analysis
  is provided and numerical experiments support our theoretical results.
