title: A Hybrid Approach for Probabilistic Inference using Random Projections
abstract: We introduce a new meta-algorithm for probabilistic inference in graphical
  models based on random projections. The key idea is to use approximate inference
  algorithms for an (exponentially) large number of samples, obtained by randomly
  projecting the original statistical model using universal hash functions. In the
  case where the approximate inference algorithm is a variational approximation, this
  approach can be viewed as interpolating between sampling-based and variational techniques.
  The number of samples used controls the trade-off between the accuracy of the approximate
  inference algorithm and the variance of the estimator. We show empirically that
  by using random projections, we can improve the accuracy of common approximate inference
  algorithms.
