title: Safe Policy Search for Lifelong Reinforcement Learning with Sublinear Regret
abstract: Lifelong reinforcement learning provides a promising framework for developing
  versatile agents that can accumulate knowledge over a lifetime of experience and
  rapidly learn new tasks by building upon prior knowledge. However, current lifelong
  learning methods exhibit non-vanishing regret as the amount of experience increases,
  and include limitations that can lead to suboptimal or unsafe control policies.
  To address these issues, we develop a lifelong policy gradient learner that operates
  in an adversarial setting to learn multiple tasks online while enforcing safety
  constraints on the learned policies. We demonstrate, for the first time, sublinear
  regret for lifelong policy search, and validate our algorithm on several benchmark
  dynamical systems and an application to quadrotor control.
