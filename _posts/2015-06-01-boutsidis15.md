title: Spectral Clustering via the Power Method - Provably
abstract: Spectral clustering is one of the most important algorithms in data mining
  and machine intelligence; however, its computational complexity limits its application
  to truly large scale data analysis. The computational bottleneck in spectral clustering
  is computing a few of the top eigenvectors of the (normalized) Laplacian matrix
  corresponding to the graph representing the data to be clustered. One way to speed
  up the computation of these eigenvectors is to use the “power method” from the numerical
  linear algebra literature. Although the power method has been empirically used to
  speed up spectral clustering, the theory behind this approach, to the best of our
  knowledge, remains unexplored. This paper provides the first such rigorous theoretical
  justification, arguing that a small number of power iterations suffices to obtain
  near-optimal partitionings using the approximate eigenvectors. Specifically, we
  prove that solving the k-means clustering problem on the approximate eigenvectors
  obtained via the power method gives an additive-error approximation to solving the
  k-means problem on the optimal eigenvectors.
