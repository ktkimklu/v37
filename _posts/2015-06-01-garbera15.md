title: Faster Rates for the Frank-Wolfe Method over Strongly-Convex Sets
abstract: The Frank-Wolfe method (a.k.a. conditional gradient algorithm) for smooth
  optimization has regained much interest in recent years in the context of large
  scale optimization and machine learning. A key advantage of the method is that it
  avoids projections - the computational bottleneck in many applications - replacing
  it by a linear optimization step. Despite this advantage, the known convergence
  rates of the FW method fall behind standard first order methods for most settings
  of interest. It is an active line of research to derive faster linear optimization-based
  algorithms for various settings of convex optimization. In this paper we consider
  the special case of optimization over strongly convex sets, for which we prove that
  the vanila FW method converges at a rate of \frac1t^2. This gives a quadratic improvement
  in convergence rate compared to the general case, in which convergence is of the
  order \frac1t, and known to be tight. We show that various balls induced by \ell_p
  norms, Schatten norms and group norms are strongly convex on one hand and on the
  other hand, linear optimization over these sets is straightforward and admits a
  closed-form solution. We further show how several previous fast-rate results for
  the FW method follow easily from our analysis.
