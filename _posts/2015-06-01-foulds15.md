title: 'Latent Topic Networks: A Versatile Probabilistic Programming Framework for
  Topic Models'
abstract: Topic models have become increasingly prominent text-analytic machine learning
  tools for research in the social sciences and the humanities. In particular, custom
  topic models can be developed to answer specific research questions. The design
  of these models requires a non-trivial amount of effort and expertise, motivating
  general-purpose topic modeling frameworks. In this paper we introduce latent topic
  networks, a flexible class of richly structured topic models designed to facilitate
  applied research. Custom models can straightforwardly be developed in our framework
  with an intuitive first-order logical probabilistic programming language. Latent
  topic networks admit scalable training via a parallelizable EM algorithm which leverages
  ADMM in the M-step. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the models with case
  studies on modeling influence in citation networks, and U.S. Presidential State
  of the Union addresses.
