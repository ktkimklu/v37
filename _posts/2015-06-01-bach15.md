title: Paired-Dual Learning for Fast Training of Latent Variable Hinge-Loss MRFs
abstract: Latent variables allow probabilistic graphical models to capture nuance
  and structure in important domains such as network science, natural language processing,
  and computer vision. Naive approaches to learning such complex models can be prohibitively
  expensive—because they require repeated inferences to update beliefs about latent
  variables—so lifting this restriction for useful classes of models is an important
  problem. Hinge-loss Markov random fields (HL-MRFs) are graphical models that allow
  highly scalable inference and learning in structured domains, in part by representing
  structured problems with continuous variables. However, this representation leads
  to challenges when learning with latent variables. We introduce paired-dual learning,
  a framework that greatly speeds up training by using tractable entropy surrogates
  and avoiding repeated inferences. Paired-dual learning optimizes an objective with
  a pair of dual inference problems. This allows fast, joint optimization of parameters
  and dual variables. We evaluate on social-group detection, trust prediction in social
  networks, and image reconstruction, finding that paired-dual learning trains models
  as accurate as those trained by traditional methods in much less time, often before
  traditional methods make even a single parameter update.
