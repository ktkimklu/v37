title: Convex Calibrated Surrogates for Hierarchical Classification
abstract: Hierarchical classification problems are multiclass supervised learning
  problems with a pre-defined hierarchy over the set of class labels. In this work,
  we study the consistency of hierarchical classification algorithms with respect
  to a natural loss, namely the tree distance metric on the hierarchy tree of class
  labels, via the usage of calibrated surrogates. We first show that the Bayes optimal
  classifier for this loss classifies an instance according to the deepest node in
  the hierarchy such that the total conditional probability of the subtree rooted
  at the node is greater than \frac12. We exploit this insight to develop new consistent
  algorithm for hierarchical classification, that makes use of an algorithm known
  to be consistent for the “multiclass classification with reject option (MCRO)” problem
  as a sub-routine. Our experiments on a number of benchmark datasets show that the
  resulting algorithm, which we term OvA-Cascade, gives improved performance over
  other state-of-the-art hierarchical classification algorithms.
