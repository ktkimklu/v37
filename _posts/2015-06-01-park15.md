title: 'Preference Completion: Large-scale Collaborative Ranking from Pairwise Comparisons'
abstract: 'In this paper we consider the collaborative ranking setting: a pool of
  users each provides a set of pairwise preferences over a small subset of the set
  of d possible items; from these we need to predict each user’s preferences for items
  s/he has not yet seen. We do so via fitting a rank r score matrix to the pairwise
  data, and provide two main contributions: (a) We show that an algorithm based on
  convex optimization provides good generalization guarantees once each user provides
  as few as O(r \log^2 d) pairwise comparisons — essentially matching the sample complexity
  required in the related matrix completion setting (which uses actual numerical as
  opposed to pairwise information), and also matching a lower bound we establish here.
  (b) We develop a large-scale non-convex implementation, which we call AltSVM, which
  trains a factored form of the matrix via alternating minimization (which we show
  reduces to alternating SVM problems), and scales and parallelizes very well to large
  problem settings. It also outperforms common baselines on many moderately large
  popular collaborative filtering datasets in both NDCG and other measures of ranking
  performance.'
