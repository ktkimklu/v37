title: Rademacher Observations, Private Data, and Boosting
abstract: The minimization of the logistic loss is a popular approach to batch supervised
  learning. Our paper starts from the surprising observation that, when fitting linear
  classifiers, the minimization of the logistic loss is \textitequivalent to the minimization
  of an exponential \textitrado-loss computed (i) over transformed data that we call
  Rademacher observations (rados), and (ii) over the \textitsame classifier as the
  one of the logistic loss. Thus, a classifier learnt from rados can be \textitdirectly
  used to classify \textitobservations. We provide a learning algorithm over rados
  with boosting-compliant convergence rates on the \textitlogistic loss (computed
  over examples). Experiments on domains with up to millions of examples, backed up
  by theoretical arguments, display that learning over a small set of random rados
  can challenge the state of the art that learns over the \textitcomplete set of examples.
  We show that rados comply with various privacy requirements that make them good
  candidates for machine learning in a privacy framework. We give several algebraic,
  geometric and computational hardness results on reconstructing examples from rados.
  We also show how it is possible to craft, and efficiently learn from, rados in a
  differential privacy framework. Tests reveal that learning from differentially private
  rados brings non-trivial privacy vs accuracy tradeoffs.
