title: A Convex Exemplar-based Approach to MAD-Bayes Dirichlet Process Mixture Models
abstract: MAD-Bayes (MAP-based Asymptotic Derivations) has been recently proposed
  as a general technique to derive scalable algorithm for Bayesian Nonparametric models.
  However, the combinatorial nature of objective functions derived from MAD-Bayes
  results in hard optimization problem, for which current practice employs heuristic
  algorithms analogous to k-means to find local minimum. In this paper, we consider
  the exemplar-based version of MAD-Bayes formulation for DP and Hierarchical DP (HDP)
  mixture model. We show that an exemplar-based MAD-Bayes formulation can be relaxed
  to a convex structural-regularized program that, under cluster-separation conditions,
  shares the same optimal solution to its combinatorial counterpart. An algorithm
  based on Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM) is then proposed to solve
  such program. In our experiments on several benchmark data sets, the proposed method
  finds optimal solution of the combinatorial problem and significantly improves existing
  methods in terms of the exemplar-based objective.
