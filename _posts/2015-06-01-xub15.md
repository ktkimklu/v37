title: Deep Edge-Aware Filters
abstract: There are many edge-aware filters varying in their construction forms and
  filtering properties. It seems impossible to uniformly represent and accelerate
  them in a single framework. We made the attempt to learn a big and important family
  of edge-aware operators from data. Our method is based on a deep convolutional neural
  network with a gradient domain training procedure, which gives rise to a powerful
  tool to approximate various filters without knowing the original models and implementation
  details. The only difference among these operators in our system becomes merely
  the learned parameters. Our system enables fast approximation for complex edge-aware
  filters and achieves up to 200x acceleration, regardless of their originally very
  different implementation. Fast speed can also be achieved when creating new effects
  using spatially varying filter or filter combination, bearing out the effectiveness
  of our deep edge-aware filters.
