title: Improving the Gaussian Process Sparse Spectrum Approximation by Representing
  Uncertainty in Frequency Inputs
abstract: Standard sparse pseudo-input approximations to the Gaussian process (GP)
  cannot handle complex functions well. Sparse spectrum alternatives attempt to answer
  this but are known to over-fit. We suggest the use of variational inference for
  the sparse spectrum approximation to avoid both issues. We model the covariance
  function with a finite Fourier series approximation and treat it as a random variable.
  The random covariance function has a posterior, on which a variational distribution
  is placed. The variational distribution transforms the random covariance function
  to fit the data. We study the properties of our approximate inference, compare it
  to alternative ones, and extend it to the distributed and stochastic domains. Our
  approximation captures complex functions better than standard approaches and avoids
  over-fitting.
