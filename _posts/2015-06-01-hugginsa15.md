title: 'JUMP-Means: Small-Variance Asymptotics for Markov Jump Processes'
abstract: 'Markov jump processes (MJPs) are used to model a wide range of phenomenon
  from disease progression to RNA path folding. However, existing methods suffer from
  a number of shortcomings: degenerate trajectories in the case of ML estimation of
  parametric models and poor inferential performance in the case of nonparametric
  models. We take a small-variance asymptotics (SVA) approach to overcome these limitations.
  We derive the small-variance asymptotics for parametric and nonparametric MJPs for
  both directly observed and hidden state models. In the parametric case we obtain
  a novel objective function which leads to non-degenerate trajectories. To derive
  the nonparametric version we introduce the gamma-gamma process, a novel extension
  to the gamma-exponential process. We propose algorithms for each of these formulations,
  which we call \emphJUMP-means. Our experiments demonstrate that JUMP-means is competitive
  with or outperforms widely used MJP inference approaches in terms of both speed
  and reconstruction accuracy.'
