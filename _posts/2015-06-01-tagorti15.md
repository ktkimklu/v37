title: On the Rate of Convergence and Error Bounds for LSTD(λ)
abstract: We consider LSTD(λ), the least-squares temporal-difference algorithm with
  eligibility traces algorithm proposed by Boyan (2002). It computes a linear approximation
  of the value function of a fixed policy in a large Markov Decision Process. Under
  a β-mixing assumption, we derive, for any value of λ∈(0,1), a high-probability bound
  on the rate of convergence of this algorithm to its limit. We deduce a high-probability
  bound on the error of this algorithm, that extends (and slightly improves) that
  derived by Lazaric et al. (2012) in the specific case where λ=0. In the context
  of temporal-difference algorithms with value function approximation, this analysis
  is to our knowledge the first to provide insight on the choice of the eligibility-trace
  parameter λwith respect to the approximation quality of the space and the number
  of samples.
