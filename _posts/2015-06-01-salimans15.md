title: 'Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Variational Inference: Bridging the Gap'
abstract: 'Recent advances in stochastic gradient variational inference have made
  it possible to perform variational Bayesian inference with posterior approximations
  containing auxiliary random variables. This enables us to explore a new synthesis
  of variational inference and Monte Carlo methods where we incorporate one or more
  steps of MCMC into our variational approximation. By doing so we obtain a rich class
  of inference algorithms bridging the gap between variational methods and MCMC, and
  offering the best of both worlds: fast posterior approximation through the maximization
  of an explicit objective, with the option of trading off additional computation
  for additional accuracy. We describe the theoretical foundations that make this
  possible and show some promising first results.'
