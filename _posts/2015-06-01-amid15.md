title: 'Multiview Triplet Embedding: Learning Attributes in Multiple Maps'
abstract: For humans, it is usually easier to make statements about the similarity
  of objects in relative, rather than absolute terms. Moreover, subjective comparisons
  of objects can be based on a number of different and independent attributes. For
  example, objects can be compared based on their shape, color, etc. In this paper,
  we consider the problem of uncovering these hidden attributes given a set of relative
  distance judgments in the form of triplets. The attribute that was used to generate
  a particular triplet in this set is unknown. Such data occurs, e.g., in crowdsourcing
  applications where the triplets are collected from a large group of workers. We
  propose the Multiview Triplet Embedding (MVTE) algorithm that produces a number
  of low-dimensional maps, each corresponding to one of the hidden attributes. The
  method can be used to assess how many different attributes were used to create the
  triplets, as well as to assess the difficulty of a distance comparison task, and
  find objects that have multiple interpretations in relation to the other objects.
