title: Support Matrix Machines
abstract: In many classification problems such as electroencephalogram (EEG) classification
  and image classification, the input features are naturally represented as matrices
  rather than vectors or scalars. In general, the structure information of the original
  feature matrix is useful and informative for data analysis tasks such as classification.
  One typical structure information is the correlation between columns or rows in
  the feature matrix. To leverage this kind of structure information, we propose a
  new classification method that we call support matrix machine (SMM). Specifically,
  SMM is defined as a hinge loss plus a so-called spectral elastic net penalty which
  is a spectral extension of the conventional elastic net over a matrix. The spectral
  elastic net enjoys a property of grouping effect, i.e., strongly correlated columns
  or rows tend to be selected altogether or not. Since the optimization problem for
  SMM is convex, this encourages us to devise an alternating direction method of multipliers
  algorithm for solving the problem. Experimental results on EEG and face image classification
  data show that our model is more robust and efficient than the state-of-the-art
  methods.
