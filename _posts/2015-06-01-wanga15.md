title: 'DP-space: Bayesian Nonparametric Subspace Clustering with Small-variance Asymptotics'
abstract: Subspace clustering separates data points approximately lying on union of
  affine subspaces into several clusters. This paper presents a novel nonparametric
  Bayesian subspace clustering model that infers both the number of subspaces and
  the dimension of each subspace from the observed data. Though the posterior inference
  is hard, our model leads to a very efficient deterministic algorithm, DP-space,
  which retains the nonparametric ability under a small-variance asymptotic analysis.
  DP-space monotonically minimizes an intuitive objective with an explicit tradeoff
  between data fitness and model complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that
  DP-space outperforms various competitors in terms of clustering accuracy and at
  the same time it is highly efficient.
