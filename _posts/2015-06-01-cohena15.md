title: Following the Perturbed Leader for Online Structured Learning
abstract: We investigate a new Follow the Perturbed Leader (FTPL) algorithm for online
  structured prediction problems. We show a regret bound which is comparable to the
  state of the art of FTPL algorithms and is comparable with the best possible regret
  in some cases. To better understand FTPL algorithms for online structured learning,
  we present a lower bound on the regret for a large and natural class of FTPL algorithms
  that use logconcave perturbations. We complete our investigation with an online
  shortest path experiment and empirically show that our algorithm is both statistically
  and computationally efficient.
