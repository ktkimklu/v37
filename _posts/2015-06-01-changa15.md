title: Complex Event Detection using Semantic Saliency and Nearly-Isotonic SVM
abstract: We aim to detect complex events in long Internet videos that may last for
  hours. A major challenge in this setting is that only a few shots in a long video
  are relevant to the event of interest while others are irrelevant or even misleading.
  Instead of indifferently pooling the shots, we first define a novel notion of semantic
  saliency that assesses the relevance of each shot with the event of interest. We
  then prioritize the shots according to their saliency scores since shots that are
  semantically more salient are expected to contribute more to the final event detector.
  Next, we propose a new isotonic regularizer that is able to exploit the semantic
  ordering information. The resulting nearly-isotonic SVM classifier exhibits higher
  discriminative power. Computationally, we develop an efficient implementation using
  the proximal gradient algorithm, and we prove new, closed-form proximal steps. We
  conduct extensive experiments on three real-world video datasets and confirm the
  effectiveness of the proposed approach.
