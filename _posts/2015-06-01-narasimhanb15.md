title: Consistent Multiclass Algorithms for Complex Performance Measures
abstract: This paper presents new consistent algorithms for multiclass learning with
  complex performance measures, defined by arbitrary functions of the confusion matrix.
  This setting includes as a special case all loss-based performance measures, which
  are simply linear functions of the confusion matrix, but also includes more complex
  performance measures such as the multiclass G-mean and micro F_1 measures. We give
  a general framework for designing consistent algorithms for such performance measures
  by viewing the learning problem as an optimization problem over the set of feasible
  confusion matrices, and give two specific instantiations based on the Frank-Wolfe
  method for concave performance measures and on the bisection method for ratio-of-linear
  performance measures. The resulting algorithms are provably consistent and outperform
  a multiclass version of the state-of-the-art SVMperf method in experiments; for
  large multiclass problems, the algorithms are also orders of magnitude faster than
  SVMperf.
