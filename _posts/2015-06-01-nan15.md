title: Feature-Budgeted Random Forest
abstract: We seek decision rules for \it prediction-time cost reduction, where complete
  data is available for training, but during prediction-time, each feature can only
  be acquired for an additional cost. We propose a novel random forest algorithm to
  minimize prediction error for a user-specified \it average feature acquisition budget.
  While random forests yield strong generalization performance, they do not explicitly
  account for feature costs and furthermore require low correlation among trees, which
  amplifies costs. Our random forest grows trees with low acquisition cost and high
  strength based on greedy minimax cost-weighted-impurity splits. Theoretically, we
  establish near-optimal acquisition cost guarantees for our algorithm. Empirically,
  on a number of benchmark datasets we demonstrate competitive accuracy-cost curves
  against state-of-the-art prediction-time algorithms.
