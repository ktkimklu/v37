title: 'The Power of Randomization: Distributed Submodular Maximization on Massive
  Datasets'
abstract: A wide variety of problems in machine learning, including exemplar clustering,
  document summarization, and sensor placement, can be cast as constrained submodular
  maximization problems. Unfortunately, the resulting submodular optimization problems
  are often too large to be solved on a single machine. We consider a distributed,
  greedy algorithm that combines previous approaches with randomization. The result
  is an algorithm that is embarrassingly parallel and achieves provable, constant
  factor, worst-case approximation guarantees. In our experiments, we demonstrate
  its efficiency in large problems with different kinds of constraints with objective
  values always close to what is achievable in the centralized setting.
