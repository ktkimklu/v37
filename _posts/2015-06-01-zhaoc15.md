title: On the Relationship between Sum-Product Networks and Bayesian Networks
abstract: In this paper, we establish some theoretical connections between Sum-Product
  Networks (SPNs) and Bayesian Networks (BNs). We prove that every SPN can be converted
  into a BN in linear time and space in terms of the network size. The key insight
  is to use Algebraic Decision Diagrams (ADDs) to compactly represent the local conditional
  probability distributions at each node in the resulting BN by exploiting context-specific
  independence (CSI). The generated BN has a simple directed bipartite graphical structure.
  We show that by applying the Variable Elimination algorithm (VE) to the generated
  BN with ADD representations, we can recover the original SPN where the SPN can be
  viewed as a history record or caching of the VE inference process. To help state
  the proof clearly, we introduce the notion of \em normal SPN and present a theoretical
  analysis of the consistency and decomposability properties. We conclude the paper
  with some discussion of the implications of the proof and establish a connection
  between the depth of an SPN and a lower bound of the tree-width of its corresponding
  BN.
