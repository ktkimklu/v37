title: 'DRAW: A Recurrent Neural Network For Image Generation'
abstract: This paper introduces the Deep Recurrent Attentive Writer (DRAW) architecture
  for image generation with neural networks. DRAW networks combine a novel spatial
  attention mechanism that mimics the foveation of the human eye, with a sequential
  variational auto-encoding framework that allows for the iterative construction of
  complex images. The system substantially improves on the state of the art for generative
  models on MNIST, and, when trained on the Street View House Numbers dataset, it
  is able to generate images that are indistinguishable from real data with the naked
  eye.
