title: Geometric Conditions for Subspace-Sparse Recovery
abstract: Given a dictionary \Pi and a signal 両= \Pi \mathbf x generated by a few
  \textitlinearly independent columns of \Pi, classical sparse recovery theory deals
  with the problem of uniquely recovering the sparse representation \mathbf x of 両.
  In this work, we consider the more general case where 両lies in a low-dimensional
  subspace spanned by a few columns of \Pi, which are possibly \textitlinearly dependent.
  In this case, \mathbf x may not unique, and the goal is to recover any subset of
  the columns of \Pi that spans the subspace containing 両. We call such a representation
  \mathbf x \textitsubspace-sparse. We study conditions under which existing pursuit
  methods recover a subspace-sparse representation. Such conditions reveal important
  geometric insights and have implications for the theory of classical sparse recovery
  as well as subspace clustering.
