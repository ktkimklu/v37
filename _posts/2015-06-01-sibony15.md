title: MRA-based Statistical Learning from Incomplete Rankings
abstract: 'Statistical analysis of rank data describing preferences over small and
  variable subsets of a potentially large ensemble of items 1, ..., n is a very challenging
  problem. It is motivated by a wide variety of modern applications, such as recommender
  systems or search engines. However, very few inference methods have been documented
  in the literature to learn a ranking model from such incomplete rank data. The goal
  of this paper is twofold: it develops a rigorous mathematical framework for the
  problem of learning a ranking model from incomplete rankings and introduces a novel
  general statistical method to address it. Based on an original concept of multi-resolution
  analysis (MRA) of incomplete rankings, it finely adapts to any observation setting,
  leading to a statistical accuracy and an algorithmic complexity that depend directly
  on the complexity of the observed data. Beyond theoretical guarantees, we also provide
  experimental results that show its statistical performance.'
