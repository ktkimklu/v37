title: Submodularity in Data Subset Selection and Active Learning
abstract: We study the problem of selecting a subset of big data to train a classifier
  while incurring minimal performance loss. We show the connection of submodularity
  to the data likelihood functions for Naive Bayes (NB) and Nearest Neighbor (NN)
  classifiers, and formulate the data subset selection problems for these classifiers
  as constrained submodular maximization. Furthermore, we apply this framework to
  active learning and propose a novel scheme filtering active submodular selection
  (FASS), where we combine the uncertainty sampling method with a submodular data
  subset selection framework. We extensively evaluate the proposed framework on text
  categorization and handwritten digit recognition tasks with four different classifiers,
  including Deep Neural Network (DNN) based classifiers. Empirical results indicate
  that the proposed framework yields significant improvement over the state-of-the-art
  algorithms on all classifiers.
