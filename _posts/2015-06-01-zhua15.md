title: Towards a Lower Sample Complexity for Robust One-bit Compressed Sensing
abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on nonconvex sparsity-inducing
  penalty for one-bit compressed sensing. We prove that our algorithm has a sample
  complexity of O(s/ε^2) for strong signals, and O(s\log d/ε^2) for weak signals,
  where s is the number of nonzero entries in the signal vector, d is the signal dimension
  and εis the recovery error. For general signals, the sample complexity of our algorithm
  lies between O(s/ε^2) and O(s\log d/ε^2). This is a remarkable improvement over
  the existing best sample complexity O(s\log d/ε^2). Furthermore, we show that our
  algorithm achieves exact support recovery with high probability for strong signals.
  Our theory is verified by extensive numerical experiments, which clearly illustrate
  the superiority of our algorithm for both approximate signal and support recovery
  in the noisy setting.
