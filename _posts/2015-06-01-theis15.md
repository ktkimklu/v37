title: A trust-region method for stochastic variational inference with applications
  to streaming data
abstract: Stochastic variational inference allows for fast posterior inference in
  complex Bayesian models. However, the algorithm is prone to local optima which can
  make the quality of the posterior approximation sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters
  and initialization. We address this problem by replacing the natural gradient step
  of stochastic varitional inference with a trust-region update. We show that this
  leads to generally better results and reduced sensitivity to hyperparameters. We
  also describe a new strategy for variational inference on streaming data and show
  that here our trust-region method is crucial for getting good performance.
