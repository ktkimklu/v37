title: Fast Kronecker Inference in Gaussian Processes with non-Gaussian Likelihoods
abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are a flexible class of methods with state of the
  art performance on spatial statistics applications. However, GPs require O(n^3)
  computations and O(n^2) storage, and popular GP kernels are typically limited to
  smoothing and interpolation. To address these difficulties, Kronecker methods have
  been used to exploit structure in the GP covariance matrix for scalability, while
  allowing for expressive kernel learning (Wilson et al., 2014). However, fast Kronecker
  methods have been confined to Gaussian likelihoods. We propose new scalable Kronecker
  methods for Gaussian processes with non-Gaussian likelihoods, using a Laplace approximation
  which involves linear conjugate gradients for inference, and a lower bound on the
  GP marginal likelihood for kernel learning. Our approach has near linear scaling,
  requiring O(D n^(D+1)/D) operations and O(D n^2/D) storage, for n training data-points
  on a dense D > 1 dimensional grid. Moreover, we introduce a log Gaussian Cox process,
  with highly expressive kernels, for modelling spatiotemporal count processes, and
  apply it to a point pattern (n = 233,088) of a decade of crime events in Chicago.
  Using our model, we discover spatially varying multiscale seasonal trends and produce
  highly accurate long-range local area forecasts.
