title: Online Tracking by Learning Discriminative Saliency Map with Convolutional
  Neural Network
abstract: We propose an online visual tracking algorithm by learning discriminative
  saliency map using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Given a CNN pre-trained on
  a large-scale image repository in offline, our algorithm takes outputs from hidden
  layers of the network as feature descriptors since they show excellent representation
  performance in various general visual recognition problems. The features are used
  to learn discriminative target appearance models using an online Support Vector
  Machine (SVM). In addition, we construct target-specific saliency map by back-projecting
  CNN features with guidance of the SVM, and obtain the final tracking result in each
  frame based on the appearance model generatively constructed with the saliency map.
  Since the saliency map reveals spatial configuration of target effectively, it improves
  target localization accuracy and enables us to achieve pixel-level target segmentation.
  We verify the effectiveness of our tracking algorithm through extensive experiment
  on a challenging benchmark, where our method illustrates outstanding performance
  compared to the state-of-the-art tracking algorithms.
