title: Faster cover trees
abstract: The cover tree data structure speeds up exact nearest neighbor queries over
  arbitrary metric spaces. This paper makes cover trees even faster. In particular,
  we provide (1) a simpler definition of the cover tree that reduces the number of
  nodes from O(n) to exactly n, (2) an additional invariant that makes queries faster
  in practice, (3) algorithms for constructing and querying the tree in parallel on
  multiprocessor systems, and (4) a more cache efficient memory layout. On standard
  benchmark datasets, we reduce the number of distance computations by 10â€“50%. On
  a large-scale bioinformatics dataset, we reduce the number of distance computations
  by 71%. On a large-scale image dataset, our parallel algorithm with 16 cores reduces
  tree construction time from 3.5 hours to 12 minutes.
