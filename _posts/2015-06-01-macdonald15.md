title: Controversy in mechanistic modelling with Gaussian processes
abstract: Parameter inference in mechanistic models based on non-affine differential
  equations is computationally onerous, and various faster alternatives based on gradient
  matching have been proposed. A particularly promising approach is based on nonparametric
  Bayesian modelling with Gaussian processes, which exploits the fact that a Gaussian
  process is closed under differentiation. However, two alternative paradigms have
  been proposed. The first paradigm, proposed at NIPS 2008 and AISTATS 2013, is based
  on a product of experts approach and a marginalization over the derivatives of the
  state variables. The second paradigm, proposed at ICML 2014, is based on a probabilistic
  generative model and a marginalization over the state variables. The claim has been
  made that this leads to better inference results. In the present article, we offer
  a new interpretation of the second paradigm, which highlights the underlying assumptions,
  approximations and limitations. In particular, we show that the second paradigm
  suffers from an intrinsic identifiability problem, which the first paradigm is not
  affected by.
