title: Cheap Bandits
abstract: We consider stochastic sequential learning problems where the learner can
  observe the average reward of several actions. Such a setting is interesting in
  many applications involving monitoring and surveillance, where the set of the actions
  to observe represent some (geographical) area. The importance of this setting is
  that in these applications, it is actually cheaper to observe average reward of
  a group of actions rather than the reward of a single action. We show that when
  the reward is smooth over a given graph representing the neighboring actions, we
  can maximize the cumulative reward of learning while minimizing the sensing cost.
  In this paper we propose CheapUCB, an algorithm that matches the regret guarantees
  of the known algorithms for this setting and at the same time guarantees a linear
  cost again over them. As a by-product of our analysis, we establish a Î©(\sqrt(dT))
  lower bound on the cumulative regret of spectral bandits for a class of graphs with
  effective dimension d.
