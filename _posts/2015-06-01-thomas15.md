title: High Confidence Policy Improvement
abstract: We present a batch reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that provides probabilistic
  guarantees about the quality of each policy that it proposes, and which has no hyper-parameter
  that requires expert tuning. Specifically, the user may select any performance lower-bound
  and confidence level and our algorithm will ensure that the probability that it
  returns a policy with performance below the lower bound is at most the specified
  confidence level. We then propose an incremental algorithm that executes our policy
  improvement algorithm repeatedly to generate multiple policy improvements. We show
  the viability of our approach with a simple 4 x 4 gridworld and the standard mountain
  car problem, as well as with a digital marketing application that uses real world
  data.
