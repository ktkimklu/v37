title: Causal Inference by Identification of Vector Autoregressive Processes with
  Hidden Components
abstract: 'A widely applied approach to causal inference from a time series X, often
  referred to as “(linear) Granger causal analysis”, is to simply regress present
  on past and interpret the regression matrix \hatB causally. However, if there is
  an unmeasured time series Z that influences X, then this approach can lead to wrong
  causal conclusions, i.e., distinct from those one would draw if one had additional
  information such as Z. In this paper we take a different approach: We assume that
  X together with some hidden Z forms a first order vector autoregressive (VAR) process
  with transition matrix A, and argue why it is more valid to interpret A causally
  instead of \hatB. Then we examine under which conditions the most important parts
  of A are identifiable or almost identifiable from only X. Essentially, sufficient
  conditions are (1) non-Gaussian, independent noise or (2) no influence from X to
  Z. We present two estimation algorithms that are tailored towards conditions (1)
  and (2), respectively, and evaluate them on synthetic and real-world data. We discuss
  how to check the model using X.'
