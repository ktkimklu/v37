title: 'Guaranteed Tensor Decomposition: A Moment Approach'
abstract: We develop a theoretical and computational framework to perform guaranteed
  tensor decomposition, which also has the potential to accomplish other tensor tasks
  such as tensor completion and denoising. We formulate tensor decomposition as a
  problem of measure estimation from moments. By constructing a dual polynomial, we
  demonstrate that measure optimization returns the correct CP decomposition under
  an incoherence condition on the rank-one factors. To address the computational challenge,
  we present a hierarchy of semidefinite programs based on sums-of-squares relaxations
  of the measure optimization problem. By showing that the constructed dual polynomial
  is a sum-of-squares modulo the sphere, we prove that the smallest SDP in the relaxation
  hierarchy is exact and the decomposition can be extracted from the solution under
  the same incoherence condition. One implication is that the tensor nuclear norm
  can be computed exactly using the smallest SDP as long as the rank-one factors of
  the tensor are incoherent. Numerical experiments are conducted to test the performance
  of the moment approach.
