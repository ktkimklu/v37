title: Fictitious Self-Play in Extensive-Form Games
abstract: Fictitious play is a popular game-theoretic model of learning in games.
  However, it has received little attention in practical applications to large problems.
  This paper introduces two variants of fictitious play that are implemented in behavioural
  strategies of an extensive-form game. The first variant is a full-width process
  that is realization equivalent to its normal-form counterpart and therefore inherits
  its convergence guarantees. However, its computational requirements are linear in
  time and space rather than exponential. The second variant, Fictitious Self-Play,
  is a machine learning framework that implements fictitious play in a sample-based
  fashion. Experiments in imperfect-information poker games compare our approaches
  and demonstrate their convergence to approximate Nash equilibria.
