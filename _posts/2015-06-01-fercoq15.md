title: 'Mind the duality gap: safer rules for the Lasso'
abstract: Screening rules allow to early discard irrelevant variables from the optimization
  in Lasso problems, or its derivatives, making solvers faster. In this paper, we
  propose new versions of the so-called \textitsafe rules for the Lasso. Based on
  duality gap considerations, our new rules create safe test regions whose diameters
  converge to zero, provided that one relies on a converging solver. This property
  helps screening out more variables, for a wider range of regularization parameter
  values. In addition to faster convergence, we prove that we correctly identify the
  active sets (supports) of the solutions in finite time. While our proposed strategy
  can cope with any solver, its performance is demonstrated using a coordinate descent
  algorithm particularly adapted to machine learning use cases. Significant computing
  time reductions are obtained with respect to previous safe rules.
