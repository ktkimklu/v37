title: A Fast Variational Approach for Learning Markov Random Field Language Models
abstract: 'Language modelling is a fundamental building block of natural language
  processing. However, in practice the size of the vocabulary limits the distributions
  applicable for this task: specifically, one has to either resort to local optimization
  methods, such as those used in neural language models, or work with heavily constrained
  distributions. In this work, we take a step towards overcoming these difficulties.
  We present a method for global-likelihood optimization of a Markov random field
  language model exploiting long-range contexts in time independent of the corpus
  size. We take a variational approach to optimizing the likelihood and exploit underlying
  symmetries to greatly simplify learning. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method
  both for language modelling and for part-of-speech tagging.'
