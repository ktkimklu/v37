title: 'PeakSeg: constrained optimal segmentation and supervised penalty learning
  for peak detection in count data'
abstract: 'Peak detection is a central problem in genomic data analysis, and current
  algorithms for this task are unsupervised and mostly effective for a single data
  type and pattern (e.g. H3K4me3 data with a sharp peak pattern). We propose PeakSeg,
  a new constrained maximum likelihood segmentation model for peak detection with
  an efficient inference algorithm: constrained dynamic programming. We investigate
  unsupervised and supervised learning of penalties for the critical model selection
  problem. We show that the supervised method has state-of-the-art peak detection
  across all data sets in a benchmark that includes both sharp H3K4me3 and broad H3K36me3
  patterns.'
