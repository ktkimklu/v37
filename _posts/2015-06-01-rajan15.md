title: Bayesian Multiple Target Localization
abstract: We consider the problem of quickly localizing multiple targets by asking
  questions of the form â€œHow many targets are within this set" while obtaining noisy
  answers. This setting is a generalization to multiple targets of the game of 20
  questions in which only a single target is queried. We assume that the targets are
  points on the real line, or in a two dimensional plane for the experiments, drawn
  independently from a known distribution. We evaluate the performance of a policy
  using the expected entropy of the posterior distribution after a fixed number of
  questions with noisy answers. We derive a lower bound for the value of this problem
  and study a specific policy, named the dyadic policy. We show that this policy achieves
  a value which is no more than twice this lower bound when answers are noise-free,
  and show a more general constant factor approximation guarantee for the noisy setting.
  We present an empirical evaluation of this policy on simulated data for the problem
  of detecting multiple instances of the same object in an image. Finally, we present
  experiments on localizing multiple faces simultaneously on real images.
