title: An Aligned Subtree Kernel for Weighted Graphs
abstract: In this paper, we develop a new entropic matching kernel for weighted graphs
  by aligning depth-based representations. We demonstrate that this kernel can be
  seen as an \textbfaligned subtree kernel that incorporates explicit subtree correspondences,
  and thus addresses the drawback of neglecting the relative locations between substructures
  that arises in the R-convolution kernels. Experiments on standard datasets demonstrate
  that our kernel can easily outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels in terms of
  classification accuracy.
