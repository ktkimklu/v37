title: Latent Gaussian Processes for Distribution Estimation of Multivariate Categorical
  Data
abstract: Multivariate categorical data occur in many applications of machine learning.
  One of the main difficulties with these vectors of categorical variables is sparsity.
  The number of possible observations grows exponentially with vector length, but
  dataset diversity might be poor in comparison. Recent models have gained significant
  improvement in supervised tasks with this data. These models embed observations
  in a continuous space to capture similarities between them. Building on these ideas
  we propose a Bayesian model for the unsupervised task of distribution estimation
  of multivariate categorical data. We model vectors of categorical variables as generated
  from a non-linear transformation of a continuous latent space. Non-linearity captures
  multi-modality in the distribution. The continuous representation addresses sparsity.
  Our model ties together many existing models, linking the linear categorical latent
  Gaussian model, the Gaussian process latent variable model, and Gaussian process
  classification. We derive inference for our model based on recent developments in
  sampling based variational inference. We show empirically that the model outperforms
  its linear and discrete counterparts in imputation tasks of sparse data.
