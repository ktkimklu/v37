title: Approval Voting and Incentives in Crowdsourcing
abstract: 'The growing need for labeled training data has made crowdsourcing an important
  part of machine learning. The quality of crowdsourced labels is, however, adversely
  affected by three factors: (1) the workers are not experts; (2) the incentives of
  the workers are not aligned with those of the requesters; and (3) the interface
  does not allow workers to convey their knowledge accurately, by forcing them to
  make a single choice among a set of options. In this paper, we address these issues
  by introducing approval voting to utilize the expertise of workers who have partial
  knowledge of the true answer, and coupling it with a ("strictly proper") incentive-compatible
  compensation mechanism. We show rigorous theoretical guarantees of optimality of
  our mechanism together with a simple axiomatic characterization. We also conduct
  preliminary empirical studies on Amazon Mechanical Turk which validate our approach.'
