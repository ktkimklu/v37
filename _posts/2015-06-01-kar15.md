title: Surrogate Functions for Maximizing Precision at the Top
abstract: The problem of maximizing precision at the top of a ranked list, often dubbed
  Precision@k (prec@k), finds relevance in myriad learning applications such as ranking,
  multi-label classification, and learning with severe label imbalance. However, despite
  its popularity, there exist significant gaps in our understanding of this problem
  and its associated performance measure. The most notable of these is the lack of
  a convex upper bounding surrogate for prec@k. We also lack scalable perceptron and
  stochastic gradient descent algorithms for optimizing this performance measure.
  In this paper we make key contributions in these directions. At the heart of our
  results is a family of truly upper bounding surrogates for prec@k. These surrogates
  are motivated in a principled manner and enjoy attractive properties such as consistency
  to prec@k under various natural margin/noise conditions. These surrogates are then
  used to design a class of novel perceptron algorithms for optimizing prec@k with
  provable mistake bounds. We also devise scalable stochastic gradient descent style
  methods for this problem with provable convergence bounds. Our proofs rely on novel
  uniform convergence bounds which require an in-depth analysis of the structural
  properties of prec@k and its surrogates. We conclude with experimental results comparing
  our algorithms with state-of-the-art cutting plane and stochastic gradient algorithms
  for maximizing prec@k.
