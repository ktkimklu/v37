title: Stochastic Primal-Dual Coordinate Method for Regularized Empirical Risk Minimization
abstract: We consider a generic convex optimization problem associated with regularized
  empirical risk minimization of linear predictors. The problem structure allows us
  to reformulate it as a convex-concave saddle point problem. We propose a stochastic
  primal-dual coordinate method, which alternates between maximizing over one (or
  more) randomly chosen dual variable and minimizing over the primal variable. We
  also develop an extension to non-smooth and non-strongly convex loss functions,
  and an extension with better convergence rate on unnormalized data. Both theoretically
  and empirically, we show that the SPDC method has comparable or better performance
  than several state-of-the-art optimization methods.
