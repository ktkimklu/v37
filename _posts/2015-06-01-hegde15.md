title: A Nearly-Linear Time Framework for Graph-Structured Sparsity
abstract: We introduce a framework for sparsity structures defined via graphs. Our
  approach is flexible and generalizes several previously studied sparsity models.
  Moreover, we provide efficient projection algorithms for our sparsity model that
  run in nearly-linear time. In the context of sparse recovery, we show that our framework
  achieves an information-theoretically optimal sample complexity for a wide range
  of parameters. We complement our theoretical analysis with experiments demonstrating
  that our algorithms improve on prior work also in practice.
