title: Statistical and Algorithmic Perspectives on Randomized Sketching for Ordinary
  Least-Squares
abstract: We consider statistical and algorithmic aspects of solving large-scale least-squares
  (LS) problems using randomized sketching algorithms. Prior results show that, from
  an \emphalgorithmic perspective, when using sketching matrices constructed from
  random projections and leverage-score sampling, if the number of samples r much
  smaller than the original sample size n, then the worst-case (WC) error is the same
  as solving the original problem, up to a very small relative error. From a \emphstatistical
  perspective, one typically considers the mean-squared error performance of randomized
  sketching algorithms, when data are generated according to a statistical linear
  model. In this paper, we provide a rigorous comparison of both perspectives leading
  to insights on how they differ. To do this, we first develop a framework for assessing,
  in a unified manner, algorithmic and statistical aspects of randomized sketching
  methods. We then consider the statistical prediction efficiency (PE) and the statistical
  residual efficiency (RE) of the sketched LS estimator; and we use our framework
  to provide upper bounds for several types of random projection and random sampling
  algorithms. Among other results, we show that the RE can be upper bounded when r
  is much smaller than n, while the PE typically requires the number of samples r
  to be substantially larger. Lower bounds developed in subsequent work show that
  our upper bounds on PE can not be improved.
