title: Correlation Clustering in Data Streams
abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emphcorrelation clustering in
  the dynamic data stream model. The stream consists of updates to the edge weights
  of a graph on n nodes and the goal is to find a node-partition such that the end-points
  of negative-weight edges are typically in different clusters whereas the end-points
  of positive-weight edges are typically in the same cluster. We present polynomial-time,
  O(n⋅\textpolylog n)-space approximation algorithms for natural problems that arise.
  We first develop data structures based on linear sketches that allow the “quality”
  of a given node-partition to be measured. We then combine these data structures
  with convex programming and sampling techniques to solve the relevant approximation
  problem. However the standard LP and SDP formulations are not obviously solvable
  in O(n⋅\textpolylog n)-space. Our work presents space-efficient algorithms for the
  convex programming required, as well as approaches to reduce the adaptivity of the
  sampling. Note that the improved space and running-time bounds achieved from streaming
  algorithms are also useful for offline settings such as MapReduce models.
