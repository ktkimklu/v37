title: Threshold Influence Model for Allocating Advertising Budgets
abstract: We propose a new influence model for allocating budgets to advertising channels.
  Our model captures customerâ€™s sensitivity to advertisements as a threshold behavior;
  a customer is expected to be influenced if the influence he receives exceeds his
  threshold. Over the threshold model, we discuss two optimization problems. The first
  one is the budget-constrained influence maximization. We propose two greedy algorithms
  based on different strategies, and analyze the performance when the influence is
  submodular. We then introduce a new characteristic to measure the cost-effectiveness
  of a marketing campaign, that is, the proportion of the resulting influence to the
  cost spent. We design an almost linear-time approximation algorithm to maximize
  the cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, we design a better-approximation algorithm
  based on linear programming for a special case. We conduct thorough experiments
  to confirm that our algorithms outperform baseline algorithms.
