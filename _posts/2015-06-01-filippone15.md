title: Enabling scalable stochastic gradient-based inference for Gaussian processes
  by employing the Unbiased LInear System SolvEr (ULISSE)
abstract: In applications of Gaussian processes where quantification of uncertainty
  is of primary interest, it is necessary to accurately characterize the posterior
  distribution over covariance parameters. This paper proposes an adaptation of the
  Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics algorithm to draw samples from the posterior
  distribution over covariance parameters with negligible bias and without the need
  to compute the marginal likelihood. In Gaussian process regression, this has the
  enormous advantage that stochastic gradients can be computed by solving linear systems
  only. A novel unbiased linear systems solver based on parallelizable covariance
  matrix-vector products is developed to accelerate the unbiased estimation of gradients.
  The results demonstrate the possibility to enable scalable and exact (in a Monte
  Carlo sense) quantification of uncertainty in Gaussian processes without imposing
  any special structure on the covariance or reducing the number of input vectors.
