title: An Online Learning Algorithm for Bilinear Models
abstract: We investigate the bilinear model, which is a matrix form linear model with
  the rank 1 constraint. A new online learning algorithm is proposed to train the
  model parameters. Our algorithm runs in the manner of online mirror descent, and
  gradients are computed by the power iteration. To analyze it, we give a new second
  order approximation of the squared spectral norm, which helps us to get a regret
  bound. Experiments on two sequential labelling tasks give positive results.
