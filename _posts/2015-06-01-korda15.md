title: 'On TD(0) with function approximation: Concentration bounds and a centered
  variant with exponential convergence'
abstract: We provide non-asymptotic bounds for the well-known temporal difference
  learning algorithm TD(0) with linear function approximators. These include high-probability
  bounds as well as bounds in expectation. Our analysis suggests that a step-size
  inversely proportional to the number of iterations cannot guarantee optimal rate
  of convergence unless we assume (partial) knowledge of the stationary distribution
  for the Markov chain underlying the policy considered. We also provide bounds for
  the iterate averaged TD(0) variant, which gets rid of the step-size dependency while
  exhibiting the optimal rate of convergence. Furthermore, we propose a variant of
  TD(0) with linear approximators that incorporates a centering sequence, and establish
  that it exhibits an exponential rate of convergence in expectation. We demonstrate
  the usefulness of our bounds on two synthetic experimental settings.
