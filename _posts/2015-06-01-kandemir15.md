title: Asymmetric Transfer Learning with Deep Gaussian Processes
abstract: We introduce a novel Gaussian process based Bayesian model for asymmetric
  transfer learning. We adopt a two-layer feed-forward deep Gaussian process as the
  task learner of source and target domains. The first layer projects the data onto
  a separate non-linear manifold for each task. We perform knowledge transfer by projecting
  the target data also onto the source domain and linearly combining its representations
  on the source and target domain manifolds. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
  in a benchmark real-world image categorization task, and improves on it in cross-tissue
  tumor detection from histopathology tissue slide images.
