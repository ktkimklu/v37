title: 'Stay on path: PCA along graph paths'
abstract: 'We introduce a variant of (sparse) PCA in which the set of feasible support
  sets is determined by a graph. In particular, we consider the following setting:
  given a directed acyclic graph G on p vertices corresponding to variables, the non-zero
  entries of the extracted principal component must coincide with vertices lying along
  a path in G. From a statistical perspective, information on the underlying network
  may potentially reduce the number of observations required to recover the population
  principal component. We consider the canonical estimator which optimally exploits
  the prior knowledge by solving a non-convex quadratic maximization on the empirical
  covariance. We introduce a simple network and analyze the estimator under the spiked
  covariance model for sparse PCA. We show that side information potentially improves
  the statistical complexity. We propose two algorithms to approximate the solution
  of the constrained quadratic maximization, and recover a component with the desired
  properties. We empirically evaluate our schemes on synthetic and real datasets.'
