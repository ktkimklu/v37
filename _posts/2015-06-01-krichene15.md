title: The Hedge Algorithm on a Continuum
abstract: We consider an online optimization problem on a subset S of R^n (not necessarily
  convex), in which a decision maker chooses, at each iteration t, a probability distribution
  x^(t) over S, and seeks to minimize a cumulative expected loss, where each loss
  is a Lipschitz function revealed at the end of iteration t. Building on previous
  work, we propose a generalized Hedge algorithm and show a O(\sqrtt \log t) bound
  on the regret when the losses are uniformly Lipschitz and S is uniformly fat (a
  weaker condition than convexity). Finally, we propose a generalization to the dual
  averaging method on the set of Lebesgue-continuous distributions over S.
