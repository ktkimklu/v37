title: On Symmetric and Asymmetric LSHs for Inner Product Search
abstract: We consider the problem of designing locality sensitive hashes (LSH) for
  inner product similarity, and of the power of asymmetric hashes in this context.
  Shrivastava and Li (2014a) argue that there is no symmetric LSH for the problem
  and propose an asymmetric LSH based on different mappings for query and database
  points. However, we show there does exist a simple symmetric LSH that enjoys stronger
  guarantees and better empirical performance than the asymmetric LSH they suggest.
  We also show a variant of the settings where asymmetry is in-fact needed, but there
  a different asymmetric LSH is required.
