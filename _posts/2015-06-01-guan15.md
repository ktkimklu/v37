title: Moderated and Drifting Linear Dynamical Systems
abstract: We consider linear dynamical systems, particularly coupled linear oscillators,
  where the parameters represent meaningful values in a domain theory and thus learning
  what affects them contributes to explanation. Rather than allow perturbations of
  latent states, we assume that temporal variation beyond noise is explained by parameter
  drift, and variation across coupled systems is a function of moderating variables.
  This change of focus reduces opportunities for efficient inference, and we propose
  sampling procedures to learn and fit the models. We test our approach on a real
  dataset of physiological measures of heterosexual couples engaged in a conversation
  about a potentially emotional topic, with body mass index (BMI) being considered
  as a moderator. We evaluate several models on their ability to predict future conversation
  dynamics (the last 20% of the data for each test couple), with shared parameters
  being learned using held out data. As proof of concept, we validate the hypothesis
  that BMI affects the conversation dynamic in the experimentally chosen topic.
