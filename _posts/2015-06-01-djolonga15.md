title: Scalable Variational Inference in Log-supermodular Models
abstract: We consider the problem of approximate Bayesian inference in log-supermodular
  models. These models encompass regular pairwise MRFs with binary variables, but
  allow to capture high order interactions, which are intractable for existing approximate
  inference techniques such as belief propagation, mean field and variants. We show
  that a recently proposed variational approach to inference in log-supermodular models
  – L-Field – reduces to the widely studied minimum norm problem for submodular minimization.
  This insight allows to leverage powerful existing tools, and allows solving the
  variational problem orders of magnitude more efficiently than previously possible.
  We then provide another natural interpretation of L-Field, demonstrating that it
  exactly minimizes a specific type of Renyi divergence measure. This insight sheds
  light on the nature of the variational approximations produced by L-Field. Furthermore,
  we show how to perform parallel inference as message passing in a suitable factor
  graph at a linear convergence rate, without having to sum up over all the configurations
  of the factor. Finally, we apply our approach to a challenging image segmentation
  task. Our experiments confirm scalability of our approach, high quality of the marginals
  and the benefit of incorporating higher order potentials.
