title: A Multitask Point Process Predictive Model
abstract: Point process data are commonly observed in fields like healthcare and social
  science. Designing predictive models for such event streams is an under-explored
  problem, due to often scarce training data. In this work we propose a multitask
  point process model, leveraging information from all tasks via a hierarchical Gaussian
  process (GP). Nonparametric learning functions implemented by a GP, which map from
  past events to future rates, allow analysis of flexible arrival patterns. To facilitate
  efficient inference, we propose a sparse construction for this hierarchical model,
  and derive a variational Bayes method for learning and inference. Experimental results
  are shown on both synthetic data and an application on real electronic health records.
