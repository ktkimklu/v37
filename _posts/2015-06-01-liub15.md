title: Scalable Model Selection for Large-Scale Factorial Relational Models
abstract: 'With a growing need to understand large-scale networks, factorial relational
  models, such as binary matrix factorization models (BMFs), have become important
  in many applications. Although BMFs have a natural capability to uncover overlapping
  group structures behind network data, existing inference techniques have issues
  of either high computational cost or lack of model selection capability, and this
  limits their applicability. For scalable model selection of BMFs, this paper proposes
  stochastic factorized asymptotic Bayesian (sFAB) inference that combines concepts
  in two recently-developed techniques: stochastic variational inference (SVI) and
  FAB inference. sFAB is a highly-efficient algorithm, having both scalability and
  an inherent model selection capability in a single inference framework. Empirical
  results show the superiority of sFAB/BMF in both accuracy and scalability over state-of-the-art
  inference methods for overlapping relational models.'
