title: On the Optimality of Multi-Label Classification under Subset Zero-One Loss
  for Distributions Satisfying the Composition Property
abstract: The benefit of exploiting label dependence in multi-label classification
  is known to be closely dependent on the type of loss to be minimized. In this paper,
  we show that the subsets of labels that appear as irreducible factors in the factorization
  of the conditional distribution of the label set given the input features play a
  pivotal role for multi-label classification in the context of subset Zero-One loss
  minimization, as they divide the learning task into simpler independent multi-class
  problems. We establish theoretical results to characterize and identify these irreducible
  label factors for any given probability distribution satisfying the Composition
  property. The analysis lays the foundation for generic multi-label classification
  and optimal feature subset selection procedures under this subclass of distributions.
  Our conclusions are supported by carefully designed experiments on synthetic and
  benchmark data.
