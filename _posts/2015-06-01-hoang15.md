title: A Unifying Framework of Anytime Sparse Gaussian Process Regression Models with
  Stochastic Variational Inference for Big Data
abstract: This paper presents a novel unifying framework of anytime sparse Gaussian
  process regression (SGPR) models that can produce good predictive performance fast
  and improve their predictive performance over time. Our proposed unifying framework
  reverses the variational inference procedure to theoretically construct a non-trivial,
  concave functional that is maximized at the predictive distribution of any SGPR
  model of our choice. As a result, a stochastic natural gradient ascent method can
  be derived that involves iteratively following the stochastic natural gradient of
  the functional to improve its estimate of the predictive distribution of the chosen
  SGPR model and is guaranteed to achieve asymptotic convergence to it. Interestingly,
  we show that if the predictive distribution of the chosen SGPR model satisfies certain
  decomposability conditions, then the stochastic natural gradient is an unbiased
  estimator of the exact natural gradient and can be computed in constant time (i.e.,
  independent of data size) at each iteration. We empirically evaluate the trade-off
  between the predictive performance vs. time efficiency of the anytime SGPR models
  on two real-world million-sized datasets.
