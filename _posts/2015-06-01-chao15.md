title: Exponential Integration for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
abstract: We investigate numerical integration of ordinary differential equations
  (ODEs) for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). High-quality integration is crucial for
  designing efficient and effective proposals for HMC. While the standard method is
  leapfrog (Stormer-Verlet) integration, we propose the use of an exponential integrator,
  which is robust to stiff ODEs with highly-oscillatory components. This oscillation
  is difficult to reproduce using leapfrog integration, even with carefully selected
  integration parameters and preconditioning. Concretely, we use a Gaussian distribution
  approximation to segregate stiff components of the ODE. We integrate this term analytically
  for stability and account for deviation from the approximation using variation of
  constants. We consider various ways to derive Gaussian approximations and conduct
  extensive empirical studies applying the proposed “exponential HMC” to several benchmarked
  learning problems. We compare to state-of-the-art methods for improving leapfrog
  HMC and demonstrate the advantages of our method in generating many effective samples
  with high acceptance rates in short running times.
