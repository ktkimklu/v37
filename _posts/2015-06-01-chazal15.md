title: Subsampling Methods for Persistent Homology
abstract: Persistent homology is a multiscale method for analyzing the shape of sets
  and functions from point cloud data arising from an unknown distribution supported
  on those sets. When the size of the sample is large, direct computation of the persistent
  homology is prohibitive due to the combinatorial nature of the existing algorithms.
  We propose to compute the persistent homology of several subsamples of the data
  and then combine the resulting estimates. We study the risk of two estimators and
  we prove that the subsampling approach carries stable topological information while
  achieving a great reduction in computational complexity.
