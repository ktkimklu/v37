title: PU Learning for Matrix Completion
abstract: 'In this paper, we consider the matrix completion problem when the observations
  are one-bit measurements of some underlying matrix M , and in particular the observed
  samples consist only of ones and no zeros. This problem is motivated by modern applications
  such as recommender systems and social networks where only “likes” or “friendships”
  are observed. The problem is an instance of PU (positive-unlabeled) learning, i.e.
  learning from only positive and unlabeled examples that has been studied in the
  context of binary classification. Under the assumption that M has bounded nuclear
  norm, we provide recovery guarantees for two different observation models: 1) M
  parameterizes a distribution that generates a binary matrix, 2) M is thresholded
  to obtain a binary matrix. For the first case, we propose a “shifted matrix completion”
  method that recovers M using only a subset of indices corresponding to ones; for
  the second case, we propose a “biased matrix completion” method that recovers the
  (thresholded) binary matrix. Both methods yield strong error bounds — if M ∈R^n
  \times n, the error is bounded as O(1-ρ) , where 1-ρdenotes the fraction of ones
  observed. This implies a sample complexity of O(n log n) ones to achieve a small
  error, when M is dense and n is large. We extend our analysis to the inductive matrix
  completion problem, where rows and columns of M have associated features. We develop
  efficient and scalable optimization procedures for both the proposed methods and
  demonstrate their effectiveness for link prediction (on real-world networks consisting
  of over 2 million nodes and 90 million links) and semi-supervised clustering tasks.'
