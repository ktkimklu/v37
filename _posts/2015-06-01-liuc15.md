title: Bipartite Edge Prediction via Transductive Learning over Product Graphs
abstract: This paper addresses the problem of predicting the missing edges of a bipartite
  graph where each side of the vertices has its own intrinsic structure. We propose
  a new optimization framework to map the two sides of the intrinsic structures onto
  the manifold structure of the edges via a graph product, and to reduce the original
  problem to vertex label propagation over the product graph. This framework enjoys
  flexible choices in the formulation of graph products, and supports a rich family
  of graph transduction schemes with scalable inference. Experiments on benchmark
  datasets for collaborative filtering, citation network analysis and prerequisite
  prediction of online courses show advantageous performance of the proposed approach
  over other state-of-the-art methods.
