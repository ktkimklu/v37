title: 'Dynamic Sensing: Better Classification under Acquisition Constraints'
abstract: In many machine learning applications the quality of the data is limited
  by resource constraints (may it be power, bandwidth, memory, ...). In such cases,
  the constraints are on the average resources allocated, therefore there is some
  control over each sample’s quality. In most cases this option remains unused and
  the data’s quality is uniform over the samples. In this paper we propose to actively
  allocate resources to each sample such that resources are used optimally overall.
  We propose a method to compute the optimal resource allocation. We further derive
  generalization bounds for the case where the problem’s model is unknown. We demonstrate
  the potential benefit of this approach on both simulated and real-life problems.
