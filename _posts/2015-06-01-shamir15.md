title: A Stochastic PCA and SVD Algorithm with an Exponential Convergence Rate
abstract: We describe and analyze a simple algorithm for principal component analysis
  and singular value decomposition, VR-PCA, which uses computationally cheap stochastic
  iterations, yet converges exponentially fast to the optimal solution. In contrast,
  existing algorithms suffer either from slow convergence, or computationally intensive
  iterations whose runtime scales with the data size. The algorithm builds on a recent
  variance-reduced stochastic gradient technique, which was previously analyzed for
  strongly convex optimization, whereas here we apply it to an inherently non-convex
  problem, using a very different analysis.
