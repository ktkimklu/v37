title: Multi-view Sparse Co-clustering via Proximal Alternating Linearized Minimization
abstract: When multiple views of data are available for a set of subjects, co-clustering
  aims to identify subject clusters that agree across the different views. We explore
  the problem of co-clustering when the underlying clusters exist in different subspaces
  of each view. We propose a proximal alternating linearized minimization algorithm
  that simultaneously decomposes multiple data matrices into sparse row and columns
  vectors. This approach is able to group subjects consistently across the views and
  simultaneously identify the subset of features in each view that are associated
  with the clusters. The proposed algorithm can globally converge to a critical point
  of the problem. A simulation study validates that the proposed algorithm can identify
  the hypothesized clusters and their associated features. Comparison with several
  latest multi-view co-clustering methods on benchmark datasets demonstrates the superior
  performance of the proposed approach.
