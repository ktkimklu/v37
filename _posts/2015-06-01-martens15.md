title: Optimizing Neural Networks with Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature
abstract: We propose an efficient method for approximating natural gradient descent
  in neural networks which we call Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC).
  K-FAC is based on an efficiently invertible approximation of a neural network’s
  Fisher information matrix which is neither diagonal nor low-rank, and in some cases
  is completely non-sparse. It is derived by approximating various large blocks of
  the Fisher (corresponding to entire layers) as being the Kronecker product of two
  much smaller matrices. While only several times more expensive to compute than the
  plain stochastic gradient, the updates produced by K-FAC make much more progress
  optimizing the objective, which results in an algorithm that can be much faster
  than stochastic gradient descent with momentum in practice. And unlike some previously
  proposed approximate natural-gradient/Newton methods which use high-quality non-diagonal
  curvature matrices (such as Hessian-free optimization), K-FAC works very well in
  highly stochastic optimization regimes. This is because the cost of storing and
  inverting K-FAC’s approximation to the curvature matrix does not depend on the amount
  of data used to estimate it, which is a feature typically associated only with diagonal
  or low-rank approximations to the curvature matrix.
