title: Coresets for Nonparametric Estimation - the Case of DP-Means
abstract: Scalable training of Bayesian nonparametric models is a notoriously difficult
  challenge. We explore the use of coresets - a data summarization technique originating
  from computational geometry - for this task. Coresets are weighted subsets of the
  data such that models trained on these coresets are provably competitive with models
  trained on the full dataset. Coresets sublinear in the dataset size allow for fast
  approximate inference with provable guarantees. Existing constructions, however,
  are limited to parametric problems. Using novel techniques in coreset construction
  we show the existence of coresets for DP-Means - a prototypical nonparametric clustering
  problem - and provide a practical construction algorithm. We empirically demonstrate
  that our algorithm allows us to efficiently trade off computation time and approximation
  error and thus scale DP-Means to large datasets. For instance, with coresets we
  can obtain a computational speedup of 45x at an approximation error of only 2.4%
  compared to solving on the full data set. In contrast, for the same subsample size,
  the “naive” approach of uniformly subsampling the data incurs an approximation error
  of 22.5%.
