title: A Deterministic Analysis of Noisy Sparse Subspace Clustering for Dimensionality-reduced
  Data
abstract: Subspace clustering groups data into several lowrank subspaces. In this
  paper, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze a popular optimization-based
  algorithm, Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC), when the data dimension is compressed
  via some random projection algorithms. We show SSC provably succeeds if the random
  projection is a subspace embedding, which includes random Gaussian projection, uniform
  row sampling, FJLT, sketching, etc. Our analysis applies to the most general deterministic
  setting and is able to handle both adversarial and stochastic noise. It also results
  in the first algorithm for privacy-preserved subspace clustering.
