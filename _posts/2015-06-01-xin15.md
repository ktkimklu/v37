title: Pushing the Limits of Affine Rank Minimization by Adapting Probabilistic PCA
abstract: Many applications require recovering a matrix of minimal rank within an
  affine constraint set, with matrix completion a notable special case. Because the
  problem is NP-hard in general, it is common to replace the matrix rank with the
  nuclear norm, which acts as a convenient convex surrogate. While elegant theoretical
  conditions elucidate when this replacement is likely to be successful, they are
  highly restrictive and convex algorithms fail when the ambient rank is too high
  or when the constraint set is poorly structured. Non-convex alternatives fare somewhat
  better when carefully tuned; however, convergence to locally optimal solutions remains
  a continuing source of failure. Against this backdrop we derive a deceptively simple
  and parameter-free probabilistic PCA-like algorithm that is capable, over a wide
  battery of empirical tests, of successful recovery even at the theoretical limit
  where the number of measurements equals the degrees of freedom in the unknown low-rank
  matrix. Somewhat surprisingly, this is possible even when the affine constraint
  set is highly ill-conditioned. While proving general recovery guarantees remains
  evasive for non-convex algorithms, Bayesian-inspired or otherwise, we nonetheless
  show conditions whereby the underlying cost function has a unique stationary point
  located at the global optimum; no existing cost function we are aware of satisfies
  this property. The algorithm has also been successfully deployed on a computer vision
  application involving image rectification and a standard collaborative filtering
  benchmark.
