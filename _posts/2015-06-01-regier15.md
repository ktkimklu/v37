title: 'Celeste: Variational inference for a generative model of astronomical images'
abstract: We present a new, fully generative model of optical telescope image sets,
  along with a variational procedure for inference. Each pixel intensity is treated
  as a Poisson random variable, with a rate parameter dependent on latent properties
  of stars and galaxies. Key latent properties are themselves random, with scientific
  prior distributions constructed from large ancillary data sets. We check our approach
  on synthetic images. We also run it on images from a major sky survey, where it
  exceeds the performance of the current state-of-the-art method for locating celestial
  bodies and measuring their colors.
