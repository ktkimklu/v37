title: Finding Linear Structure in Large Datasets with Scalable Canonical Correlation
  Analysis
abstract: Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a widely used spectral technique
  for finding correlation structures in multi-view datasets. In this paper, we tackle
  the problem of large scale CCA, where classical algorithms, usually requiring computing
  the product of two huge matrices and huge matrix decomposition, are computationally
  and storage expensive. We recast CCA from a novel perspective and propose a scalable
  and memory efficient \textitAugmented Approximate Gradient (AppGrad) scheme for
  finding top k dimensional canonical subspace which only involves large matrix multiplying
  a thin matrix of width k and small matrix decomposition of dimension k\times k.
  Further, \textitAppGrad achieves optimal storage complexity O(k(p_1+p_2)), compared
  with classical algorithms which usually require O(p_1^2+p_2^2) space to store two
  dense whitening matrices. The proposed scheme naturally generalizes to stochastic
  optimization regime, especially efficient for huge datasets where batch algorithms
  are prohibitive. The online property of stochastic \textitAppGrad is also well suited
  to the streaming scenario, where data comes sequentially. To the best of our knowledge,
  it is the first stochastic algorithm for CCA. Experiments on four real data sets
  are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
