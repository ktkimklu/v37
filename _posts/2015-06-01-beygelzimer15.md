title: Optimal and Adaptive Algorithms for Online Boosting
abstract: We study online boosting, the task of converting any weak online learner
  into a strong online learner. Based on a novel and natural definition of weak online
  learnability, we develop two online boosting algorithms. The first algorithm is
  an online version of boost-by-majority. By proving a matching lower bound, we show
  that this algorithm is essentially optimal in terms of the number of weak learners
  and the sample complexity needed to achieve a specified accuracy. The second algorithm
  is adaptive and parameter-free, albeit not optimal.
