title: Landmarking Manifolds with Gaussian Processes
abstract: We present an algorithm for finding landmarks along a manifold. These landmarks
  provide a small set of locations spaced out along the manifold such that they capture
  the low-dimensional non-linear structure of the data embedded in the high-dimensional
  space. The approach does not select points directly from the dataset, but instead
  we optimize each landmark by moving along the continuous manifold space (as approximated
  by the data) according to the gradient of an objective function. We borrow ideas
  from active learning with Gaussian processes to define the objective, which has
  the property that a new landmark is "repelled" by those currently selected, allowing
  for exploration of the manifold. We derive a stochastic algorithm for learning with
  large datasets and show results on several datasets, including the Million Song
  Dataset and articles from the New York Times.
