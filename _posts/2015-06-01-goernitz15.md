title: Hidden Markov Anomaly Detection
abstract: We introduce a new anomaly detection methodology for data with latent dependency
  structure. As a particular instantiation, we derive a hidden Markov anomaly detector
  that extends the regular one-class support vector machine. We optimize the approach,
  which is non-convex, via a DC (difference of convex functions) algorithm, and show
  that the parameter v can be conveniently used to control the number of outliers
  in the model. The empirical evaluation on artificial and real data from the domains
  of computational biology and computational sustainability shows that the approach
  can achieve significantly higher anomaly detection performance than the regular
  one-class SVM.
