title: On Identifying Good Options under Combinatorially Structured Feedback in Finite
  Noisy Environments
abstract: 'We consider the problem of identifying a good option out of finite set
  of options under combinatorially structured, noisy feedback about the quality of
  the options in a sequential process: In each round, a subset of the options, from
  an available set of subsets, can be selected to receive noisy information about
  the quality of the options in the chosen subset. The goal is to identify the highest
  quality option, or a group of options of the highest quality, with a small error
  probability, while using the smallest number of measurements. The problem generalizes
  best-arm identification problems. By extending previous work, we design new algorithms
  that are shown to be able to exploit the combinatorial structure of the problem
  in a nontrivial fashion, while being unimprovable in special cases. The algorithms
  call a set multi-covering oracle, hence their performance and efficiency is strongly
  tied to whether the associated set multi-covering problem can be efficiently solved.'
