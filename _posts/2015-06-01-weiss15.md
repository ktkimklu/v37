title: Learning Parametric-Output HMMs with Two Aliased States
abstract: In various applications involving hidden Markov models (HMMs), some of the
  hidden states are aliased, having identical output distributions. The minimality,
  identifiability and learnability of such aliased HMMs have been long standing problems,
  with only partial solutions provided thus far. In this paper we focus on parametric-output
  HMMs, whose output distributions come from a parametric family, and that have exactly
  two aliased states. For this class, we present a complete characterization of their
  minimality and identifiability. Furthermore, for a large family of parametric output
  distributions, we derive computationally efficient and statistically consistent
  algorithms to detect the presence of aliasing and learn the aliased HMM transition
  and emission parameters. We illustrate our theoretical analysis by several simulations.
