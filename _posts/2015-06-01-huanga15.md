title: Log-Euclidean Metric Learning on Symmetric Positive Definite Manifold with
  Application to Image Set Classification
abstract: The manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices has been successfully
  used for data representation in image set classification. By endowing the SPD manifold
  with Log-Euclidean Metric, existing methods typically work on vector-forms of SPD
  matrix logarithms. This however not only inevitably distorts the geometrical structure
  of the space of SPD matrix logarithms but also brings low efficiency especially
  when the dimensionality of SPD matrix is high. To overcome this limitation, we propose
  a novel metric learning approach to work directly on logarithms of SPD matrices.
  Specifically, our method aims to learn a tangent map that can directly transform
  the matrix logarithms from the original tangent space to a new tangent space of
  more discriminability. Under the tangent map framework, the novel metric learning
  can then be formulated as an optimization problem of seeking a Mahalanobis-like
  matrix, which can take the advantage of traditional metric learning techniques.
  Extensive evaluations on several image set classification tasks demonstrate the
  effectiveness of our proposed metric learning method.
