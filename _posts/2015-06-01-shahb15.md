title: An Empirical Study of Stochastic Variational Inference Algorithms for the Beta
  Bernoulli Process
abstract: 'Stochastic variational inference (SVI) is emerging as the most promising
  candidate for scaling inference in Bayesian probabilistic models to large datasets.
  However, the performance of these methods has been assessed primarily in the context
  of Bayesian topic models, particularly latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Deriving
  several new algorithms, and using synthetic, image and genomic datasets, we investigate
  whether the understanding gleaned from LDA applies in the setting of sparse latent
  factor models, specifically beta process factor analysis (BPFA). We demonstrate
  that the big picture is consistent: using Gibbs sampling within SVI to maintain
  certain posterior dependencies is extremely effective. However, we also show that
  different posterior dependencies are important in BPFA relative to LDA.'
