title: Random Coordinate Descent Methods for Minimizing Decomposable Submodular Functions
abstract: Submodular function minimization is a fundamental optimization problem that
  arises in several applications in machine learning and computer vision. The problem
  is known to be solvable in polynomial time, but general purpose algorithms have
  high running times and are unsuitable for large-scale problems. Recent work have
  used convex optimization techniques to obtain very practical algorithms for minimizing
  functions that are sums of “simple” functions. In this paper, we use random coordinate
  descent methods to obtain algorithms with faster \emphlinear convergence rates and
  cheaper iteration costs. Compared to alternating projection methods, our algorithms
  do not rely on full-dimensional vector operations and they converge in significantly
  fewer iterations.
