title: 'BilBOWA: Fast Bilingual Distributed Representations without Word Alignments'
abstract: We introduce BilBOWA (Bilingual Bag-of-Words without Alignments), a simple
  and computationally-efficient model for learning bilingual distributed representations
  of words which can scale to large monolingual datasets and does not require word-aligned
  parallel training data. Instead it trains directly on monolingual data and extracts
  a bilingual signal from a smaller set of raw-text sentence-aligned data. This is
  achieved using a novel sampled bag-of-words cross-lingual objective, which is used
  to regularize two noise-contrastive language models for efficient cross-lingual
  feature learning. We show that bilingual embeddings learned using the proposed model
  outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a cross-lingual document classification
  task as well as a lexical translation task on the WMT11 data.
