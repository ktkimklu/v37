title: A Relative Exponential Weighing Algorithm for Adversarial Utility-based Dueling
  Bandits
abstract: We study the K-armed dueling bandit problem which is a variation of the
  classical Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem in which the learner receives only relative
  feedback about the selected pairs of arms. We propose a new algorithm called Relative
  Exponential-weight algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation (REX3) to handle the
  adversarial utility-based formulation of this problem. This algorithm is a non-trivial
  extension of the Exponential-weight algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation (EXP3)
  algorithm. We prove a finite time expected regret upper bound of order O(sqrt(K
  ln(K)T)) for this algorithm and a general lower bound of order omega(sqrt(KT)).
  At the end, we provide experimental results using real data from information retrieval
  applications.
