title: Off-policy Model-based Learning under Unknown Factored Dynamics
abstract: Off-policy learning in dynamic decision problems is essential for providing
  strong evidence that a new policy is better than the one in use. But how can we
  prove superiority without testing the new policy? To answer this question, we introduce
  the G-SCOPE algorithm that evaluates a new policy based on data generated by the
  existing policy. Our algorithm is both computationally and sample efficient because
  it greedily learns to exploit factored structure in the dynamics of the environment.
  We present a finite sample analysis of our approach and show through experiments
  that the algorithm scales well on high-dimensional problems with few samples.
