title: Manifold-valued Dirichlet Processes
abstract: Statistical models for manifold-valued data permit capturing the intrinsic
  nature of the curved spaces in which the data lie and have been a topic of research
  for several decades. Typically, these formulations use geodesic curves and distances
  defined locally for most cases - this makes it hard to design parametric models
  globally on smooth manifolds. Thus, most (manifold specific) parametric models available
  today assume that the data lie in a small neighborhood on the manifold. To address
  this ’locality’ problem, we propose a novel nonparametric model which unifies multivariate
  general linear models (MGLMs) using multiple tangent spaces. Our framework generalizes
  existing work on (both Euclidean and non-Euclidean) general linear models providing
  a recipe to globally extend the locally-defined parametric models (using a mixture
  of local models). By grouping observations into sub-populations at multiple tangent
  spaces, our method provides insights into the hidden structure (geodesic relationships)
  in the data. This yields a framework to group observations and discover geodesic
  relationships between covariates X and manifold-valued responses Y, which we call
  Dirichlet process mixtures of multivariate general linear models (DP-MGLM) on Riemannian
  manifolds. Finally, we present proof of concept experiments to validate our model.
