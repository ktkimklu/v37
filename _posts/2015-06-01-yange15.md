title: A Divide and Conquer Framework for Distributed Graph Clustering
abstract: Graph clustering is about identifying clusters of closely connected nodes,
  and is a fundamental technique of data analysis with many applications including
  community detection, VLSI network partitioning, collaborative filtering, and many
  others. In order to improve the scalability of existing graph clustering algorithms,
  we propose a novel divide and conquer framework for graph clustering, and establish
  theoretical guarantees of exact recovery of the clusters. One additional advantage
  of the proposed framework is that it can identify small clusters – the size of the
  smallest cluster can be of size o(\sqrtn), in contrast to Ω(\sqrtn) required by
  standard methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
  the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework.
