title: 'Intersecting Faces: Non-negative Matrix Factorization With New Guarantees'
abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a natural model of admixture
  and is widely used in science and engineering. A plethora of algorithms have been
  developed to tackle NMF, but due to the non-convex nature of the problem, there
  is little guarantee on how well these methods work. Recently a surge of research
  have focused on a very restricted class of NMFs, called separable NMF, where provably
  correct algorithms have been developed. In this paper, we propose the notion of
  subset-separable NMF, which substantially generalizes the property of separability.
  We show that subset-separability is a natural necessary condition for the factorization
  to be unique or to have minimum volume. We developed the Face-Intersect algorithm
  which provably and efficiently solves subset-separable NMF under natural conditions,
  and we prove that our algorithm is robust to small noise. We explored the performance
  of Face-Intersect on simulations and discuss settings where it empirically outperformed
  the state-of-art methods. Our work is a step towards finding provably correct algorithms
  that solve large classes of NMF problems.
