title: Harmonic Exponential Families on Manifolds
abstract: In a range of fields including the geosciences, molecular biology, robotics
  and computer vision, one encounters problems that involve random variables on manifolds.
  Currently, there is a lack of flexible probabilistic models on manifolds that are
  fast and easy to train. We define an extremely flexible class of exponential family
  distributions on manifolds such as the torus, sphere, and rotation groups, and show
  that for these distributions the gradient of the log-likelihood can be computed
  efficiently using a non-commutative generalization of the Fast Fourier Transform
  (FFT). We discuss applications to Bayesian camera motion estimation (where harmonic
  exponential families serve as conjugate priors), and modelling of the spatial distribution
  of earthquakes on the surface of the earth. Our experimental results show that harmonic
  densities yield a significantly higher likelihood than the best competing method,
  while being orders of magnitude faster to train.
