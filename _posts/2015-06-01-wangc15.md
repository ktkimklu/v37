title: Multi-Task Learning for Subspace Segmentation
abstract: Subspace segmentation is the process of clustering a set of data points
  that are assumed to lie on the union of multiple linear or affine subspaces, and
  is increasingly being recognized as a fundamental tool for data analysis in high
  dimensional settings. Arguably one of the most successful approaches is based on
  the observation that the sparsest representation of a given point with respect to
  a dictionary formed by the others involves nonzero coefficients associated with
  points originating in the same subspace. Such sparse representations are computed
  independently for each data point via \ell_1-norm minimization and then combined
  into an affinity matrix for use by a final spectral clustering step. The downside
  of this procedure is two-fold. First, unlike canonical compressive sensing scenarios
  with ideally-randomized dictionaries, the data-dependent dictionaries here are unavoidably
  highly structured, disrupting many of the favorable properties of the \ell_1 norm.
  Secondly, by treating each data point independently, we ignore useful relationships
  between points that can be leveraged for jointly computing such sparse representations.
  Consequently, we motivate a multi-task learning-based framework for learning coupled
  sparse representations leading to a segmentation pipeline that is both robust against
  correlation structure and tailored to generate an optimal affinity matrix. Theoretical
  analysis and empirical tests are provided to support these claims.
