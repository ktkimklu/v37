title: Atomic Spatial Processes
abstract: The emergence of compact GPS systems and the establishment of open data
  initiatives has resulted in widespread availability of spatial data for many urban
  centres. These data can be leveraged to develop data-driven intelligent resource
  allocation systems for urban issues such as policing, sanitation, and transportation.
  We employ techniques from Bayesian non-parametric statistics to develop a process
  which captures a common characteristic of urban spatial datasets. Specifically,
  our new spatial process framework models events which occur repeatedly at discrete
  spatial points, the number and locations of which are unknown a priori. We develop
  a representation of our spatial process which facilitates posterior simulation,
  resulting in an interpretable and computationally tractable model. The framework’s
  superiority over both empirical grid-based models and Dirichlet process mixture
  models is demonstrated by fitting, interpreting, and comparing models of graffiti
  prevalence for both downtown Vancouver and Manhattan.
