title: Complete Dictionary Recovery Using Nonconvex Optimization
abstract: 'We consider the problem of recovering a complete (i.e., square and invertible)
  dictionary mb A_0, from mb Y = mb A_0 mb X_0 with mb Y âˆˆ\mathbb R^n \times p. This
  recovery setting is central to the theoretical understanding of dictionary learning.
  We give the first efficient algorithm that provably recovers mb A_0 when mb X_0
  has O(n) nonzeros per column, under suitable probability model for mb X_0. Prior
  results provide recovery guarantees when mb X_0 has only O(\sqrtn) nonzeros per
  column. Our algorithm is based on nonconvex optimization with a spherical constraint,
  and hence is naturally phrased in the language of manifold optimization. Our proofs
  give a geometric characterization of the high-dimensional objective landscape, which
  shows that with high probability there are no spurious local minima. Experiments
  with synthetic data corroborate our theory. Full version of this paper is available
