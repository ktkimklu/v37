title: Scalable Deep Poisson Factor Analysis for Topic Modeling
abstract: A new framework for topic modeling is developed, based on deep graphical
  models, where interactions between topics are inferred through deep latent binary
  hierarchies. The proposed multi-layer model employs a deep sigmoid belief network
  or restricted Boltzmann machine, the bottom binary layer of which selects topics
  for use in a Poisson factor analysis model. Under this setting, topics live on the
  bottom layer of the model, while the deep specification serves as a flexible prior
  for revealing topic structure. Scalable inference algorithms are derived by applying
  Bayesian conditional density filtering algorithm, in addition to extending recently
  proposed work on stochastic gradient thermostats. Experimental results on several
  corpora show that the proposed approach readily handles very large collections of
  text documents, infers structured topic representations, and obtains superior test
  perplexities when compared with related models.
