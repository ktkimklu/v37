title: Sparse Subspace Clustering with Missing Entries
abstract: We consider the problem of clustering incomplete data drawn from a union
  of subspaces. Classical subspace clustering methods are not applicable to this problem
  because the data are incomplete, while classical low-rank matrix completion methods
  may not be applicable because data in multiple subspaces may not be low rank. This
  paper proposes and evaluates two new approaches for subspace clustering and completion.
  The first one generalizes the sparse subspace clustering algorithm so that it can
  obtain a sparse representation of the data using only the observed entries. The
  second one estimates a suitable kernel matrix by assuming a random model for the
  missing entries and obtains the sparse representation from this kernel. Experiments
  on synthetic and real data show the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed
  methods, which all outperform the natural approach (low-rank matrix completion followed
  by sparse subspace clustering) when the data matrix is high-rank or the percentage
  of missing entries is large.
