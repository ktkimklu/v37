title: Entropic Graph-based Posterior Regularization
abstract: Graph smoothness objectives have achieved great success in semi-supervised
  learning but have not yet been applied extensively to unsupervised generative models.
  We define a new class of entropic graph-based posterior regularizers that augment
  a probabilistic model by encouraging pairs of nearby variables in a regularization
  graph to have similar posterior distributions. We present a three-way alternating
  optimization algorithm with closed-form updates for performing inference on this
  joint model and learning its parameters. This method admits updates linear in the
  degree of the regularization graph, exhibits monotone convergence and is easily
  parallelizable. We are motivated by applications in computational biology in which
  temporal models such as hidden Markov models are used to learn a human-interpretable
  representation of genomic data. On a synthetic problem, we show that our method
  outperforms existing methods for graph-based regularization and a comparable strategy
  for incorporating long-range interactions using existing methods for approximate
  inference. Using genome-scale functional genomics data, we integrate genome 3D interaction
  data into existing models for genome annotation and demonstrate significant improvements
  in predicting genomic activity.
