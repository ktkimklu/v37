title: Kernel Interpolation for Scalable Structured Gaussian Processes (KISS-GP)
abstract: We introduce a new structured kernel interpolation (SKI) framework, which
  generalises and unifies inducing point methods for scalable Gaussian processes (GPs).
  SKI methods produce kernel approximations for fast computations through kernel interpolation.
  The SKI framework clarifies how the quality of an inducing point approach depends
  on the number of inducing (aka interpolation) points, interpolation strategy, and
  GP covariance kernel. SKI also provides a mechanism to create new scalable kernel
  methods, through choosing different kernel interpolation strategies. Using SKI,
  with local cubic kernel interpolation, we introduce KISS-GP, which is 1) more scalable
  than inducing point alternatives, 2) naturally enables Kronecker and Toeplitz algebra
  for substantial additional gains in scalability, without requiring any grid data,
  and 3) can be used for fast and expressive kernel learning. KISS-GP costs O(n) time
  and storage for GP inference. We evaluate KISS-GP for kernel matrix approximation,
  kernel learning, and natural sound modelling.
