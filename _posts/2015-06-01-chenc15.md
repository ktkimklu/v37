title: Compressing Neural Networks with the Hashing Trick
abstract: 'As deep nets are increasingly used in applications suited for mobile devices,
  a fundamental dilemma becomes apparent: the trend in deep learning is to grow models
  to absorb ever-increasing data set sizes; however mobile devices are designed with
  very little memory and cannot store such large models. We present a novel network
  architecture, HashedNets, that exploits inherent redundancy in neural networks to
  achieve drastic reductions in model sizes. HashedNets uses a low-cost hash function
  to randomly group connection weights into hash buckets, and all connections within
  the same hash bucket share a single parameter value. These parameters are tuned
  to adjust to the HashedNets weight sharing architecture with standard backprop during
  training. Our hashing procedure introduces no additional memory overhead, and we
  demonstrate on several benchmark data sets that HashedNets shrink the storage requirements
  of neural networks substantially while mostly preserving generalization performance.'
