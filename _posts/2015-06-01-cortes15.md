title: Structural Maxent Models
abstract: We present a new class of density estimation models, Structural Maxent models,
  with feature functions selected from possibly very complex families. The design
  of our models is motivated by data-dependent convergence bounds and benefits from
  new data-dependent learning bounds expressed in terms of the Rademacher complexities
  of the sub-families composing the family of features considered. We prove a duality
  theorem, which we use to derive our Structural Maxent algorithm. We give a full
  description of our algorithm, including the details of its derivation and report
  the results of several experiments demonstrating that its performance compares favorably
  to that of existing regularized Maxent. We further similarly define conditional
  Structural Maxent models for multi-class classification problems. These are conditional
  probability models making use of possibly complex feature families. We also prove
  a duality theorem for these models which shows the connection between these models
  and existing binary and multi-class deep boosting algorithms.
