title: Accelerated Online Low Rank Tensor Learning for Multivariate Spatiotemporal
  Streams
abstract: 'Low-rank tensor learning has many applications in machine learning. A series
  of batch learning algorithms have achieved great successes. However, in many emerging
  applications, such as climate data analysis, we are confronted with large-scale
  tensor streams, which poses significant challenges to existing solution in terms
  of computational costs and limited response time. In this paper, we propose an online
  accelerated low-rank tensor learning algorithm (ALTO) to solve the problem. At each
  iteration, we project the current tensor to the subspace of low-rank tensors in
  order to perform efficient tensor decomposition, then recover the decomposition
  of the new tensor. By randomly glancing at additional subspaces, we successfully
  avoid local optima at negligible extra computational cost. We evaluate our method
  on two tasks in streaming multivariate spatio-temporal analysis: online forecasting
  and multi-model ensemble, which shows that our method achieves comparable predictive
  accuracy with significant boost in run time.'
