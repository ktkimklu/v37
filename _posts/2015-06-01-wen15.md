title: Efficient Learning in Large-Scale Combinatorial Semi-Bandits
abstract: A stochastic combinatorial semi-bandit is an online learning problem where
  at each step a learning agent chooses a subset of ground items subject to combinatorial
  constraints, and then observes stochastic weights of these items and receives their
  sum as a payoff. In this paper, we consider efficient learning in large-scale combinatorial
  semi-bandits with linear generalization, and as a solution, propose two learning
  algorithms called Combinatorial Linear Thompson Sampling (CombLinTS) and Combinatorial
  Linear UCB (CombLinUCB). Both algorithms are computationally efficient as long as
  the offline version of the combinatorial problem can be solved efficiently. We establish
  that CombLinTS and CombLinUCB are also provably statistically efficient under reasonable
  assumptions, by developing regret bounds that are independent of the problem scale
  (number of items) and sublinear in time. We also evaluate CombLinTS on a variety
  of problems with thousands of items. Our experiment results demonstrate that CombLinTS
  is scalable, robust to the choice of algorithm parameters, and significantly outperforms
  the best of our baselines.
