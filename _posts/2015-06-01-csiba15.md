title: Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent with Adaptive Probabilities
abstract: 'This paper introduces AdaSDCA: an adaptive variant of stochastic dual coordinate
  ascent (SDCA) for solving the regularized empirical risk minimization problems.
  Our modification consists in allowing the method adaptively change the probability
  distribution over the dual variables throughout the iterative process. AdaSDCA achieves
  provably better complexity bound than SDCA with the best fixed probability distribution,
  known as importance sampling. However, it is of a theoretical character as it is
  expensive to implement. We also propose AdaSDCA+: a practical variant which in our
  experiments outperforms existing non-adaptive methods.'
