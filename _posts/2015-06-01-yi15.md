title: 'Binary Embedding: Fundamental Limits and Fast Algorithm'
abstract: 'Binary embedding is a nonlinear dimension reduction methodology where high
  dimensional data are embedded into the Hamming cube while preserving the structure
  of the original space. Specifically, for an arbitrary N distinct points in \mathbbS^p-1,
  our goal is to encode each point using m-dimensional binary strings such that we
  can reconstruct their geodesic distance up to δuniform distortion. Existing binary
  embedding algorithms either lack theoretical guarantees or suffer from running time
  O(mp). We make three contributions: (1) we establish a lower bound that shows any
  binary embedding oblivious to the set of points requires m =Ω(\frac1δ^2\logN) bits
  and a similar lower bound for non-oblivious embeddings into Hamming distance; (2)
  we propose a novel fast binary embedding algorithm with provably optimal bit complexity
  m = O(\frac1 δ^2\logN) and near linear running time O(p \log p) whenever \log N
  ≪δ\sqrtp, with a slightly worse running time for larger \log N; (3) we also provide
  an analytic result about embedding a general set of points K ⊆\mathbbS^p-1 with
  even infinite size. Our theoretical findings are supported through experiments on
  both synthetic and real data sets.'
