title: On Deep Multi-View Representation Learning
abstract: We consider learning representations (features) in the setting in which
  we have access to multiple unlabeled views of the data for representation learning
  while only one view is available at test time. Previous work on this problem has
  proposed several techniques based on deep neural networks, typically involving either
  autoencoder-like networks with a reconstruction objective or paired feedforward
  networks with a correlation-based objective. We analyze several techniques based
  on prior work, as well as new variants, and compare them experimentally on visual,
  speech, and language domains. To our knowledge this is the first head-to-head comparison
  of a variety of such techniques on multiple tasks. We find an advantage for correlation-based
  representation learning, while the best results on most tasks are obtained with
  our new variant, deep canonically correlated autoencoders (DCCAE).
