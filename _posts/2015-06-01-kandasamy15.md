title: High Dimensional Bayesian Optimisation and Bandits via Additive Models
abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a technique used in optimising a D-dimensional
  function which is typically expensive to evaluate. While there have been many successes
  for BO in low dimensions, scaling it to high dimensions has been notoriously difficult.
  Existing literature on the topic are under very restrictive settings. In this paper,
  we identify two key challenges in this endeavour. We tackle these challenges by
  assuming an additive structure for the function. This setting is substantially more
  expressive and contains a richer class of functions than previous work. We prove
  that, for additive functions the regret has only linear dependence on D even though
  the function depends on all D dimensions. We also demonstrate several other statistical
  and computational benefits in our framework. Via synthetic examples, a scientific
  simulation and a face detection problem we demonstrate that our method outperforms
  naive BO on additive functions and on several examples where the function is not
  additive.
