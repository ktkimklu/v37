title: Streaming Sparse Principal Component Analysis
abstract: This paper considers estimating the leading k principal components with
  at most s non-zero attributes from p-dimensional samples collected sequentially
  in memory limited environments. We develop and analyze two memory and computational
  efficient algorithms called streaming sparse PCA and streaming sparse ECA for analyzing
  data generated according to the spike model and the elliptical model respectively.
  In particular, the proposed algorithms have memory complexity O(pk), computational
  complexity O(pk mink,slogp) and sample complexity Î˜(s \log p). We provide their
  finite sample performance guarantees, which implies statistical consistency in the
  high dimensional regime. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
  demonstrate good empirical performance of the proposed algorithms.
