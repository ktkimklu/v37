title: 'Double Nyström Method: An Efficient and Accurate Nyström Scheme for Large-Scale
  Data Sets'
abstract: The Nyström method has been one of the most effective techniques for kernel-based
  approach that scales well to large data sets. Since its introduction, there has
  been a large body of work that improves the approximation accuracy while maintaining
  computational efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel Nyström method that
  improves both accuracy and efficiency based on a new theoretical analysis. We first
  provide a generalized sampling scheme, CAPS, that minimizes a novel error bound
  based on the subspace distance. We then present our double Nyström method that reduces
  the size of the decomposition in two stages. We show that our method is highly efficient
  and accurate compared to other state-of-the-art Nyström methods by evaluating them
  on a number of real data sets.
