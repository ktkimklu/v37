title: Bayesian and Empirical Bayesian Forests
abstract: We derive ensembles of decision trees through a nonparametric Bayesian model,
  allowing us to view such ensembles as samples from a posterior distribution. This
  insight motivates a class of Bayesian Forest (BF) algorithms that provide small
  gains in performance and large gains in interpretability. Based on the BF framework,
  we are able to show that high-level tree hierarchy is stable in large samples. This
  motivates an empirical Bayesian Forest (EBF) algorithm for building approximate
  BFs on massive distributed datasets and we show that EBFs outperform sub-sampling
  based alternatives by a large margin.
