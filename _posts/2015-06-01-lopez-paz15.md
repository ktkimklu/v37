title: Towards a Learning Theory of Cause-Effect Inference
abstract: We pose causal inference as the problem of learning to classify probability
  distributions. In particular, we assume access to a collection {(S_i,l_i)}_i=1^n,
  where each S_i is a sample drawn from the probability distribution of X_i \times
  Y_i, and l_i is a binary label indicating whether “X_i \to Y_i” or “X_i ←Y_i”. Given
  these data, we build a causal inference rule in two steps. First, we featurize each
  S_i using the kernel mean embedding associated with some characteristic kernel.
  Second, we train a binary classifier on such embeddings to distinguish between causal
  directions. We present generalization bounds showing the statistical consistency
  and learning rates of the proposed approach, and provide a simple implementation
  that achieves state-of-the-art cause-effect inference. Furthermore, we extend our
  ideas to infer causal relationships between more than two variables.
