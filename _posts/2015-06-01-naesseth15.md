title: Nested Sequential Monte Carlo Methods
abstract: We propose nested sequential Monte Carlo (NSMC), a methodology to sample
  from sequences of probability distributions, even where the random variables are
  high-dimensional. NSMC generalises the SMC framework by requiring only approximate,
  properly weighted, samples from the SMC proposal distribution, while still resulting
  in a correct SMC algorithm. Furthermore, NSMC can in itself be used to produce such
  properly weighted samples. Consequently, one NSMC sampler can be used to construct
  an efficient high-dimensional proposal distribution for another NSMC sampler, and
  this nesting of the algorithm can be done to an arbitrary degree. This allows us
  to consider complex and high-dimensional models using SMC. We show results that
  motivate the efficacy of our approach on several filtering problems with dimensions
  in the order of 100 to 1000.
