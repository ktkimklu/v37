title: 'Cascading Bandits: Learning to Rank in the Cascade Model'
abstract: A search engine usually outputs a list of K web pages. The user examines
  this list, from the first web page to the last, and chooses the first attractive
  page. This model of user behavior is known as the cascade model. In this paper,
  we propose cascading bandits, a learning variant of the cascade model where the
  objective is to identify K most attractive items. We formulate our problem as a
  stochastic combinatorial partial monitoring problem. We propose two algorithms for
  solving it, CascadeUCB1 and CascadeKL-UCB. We also prove gap-dependent upper bounds
  on the regret of these algorithms and derive a lower bound on the regret in cascading
  bandits. The lower bound matches the upper bound of CascadeKL-UCB up to a logarithmic
  factor. We experiment with our algorithms on several problems. The algorithms perform
  surprisingly well even when our modeling assumptions are violated.
