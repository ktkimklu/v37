title: Multi-instance multi-label learning in the presence of novel class instances
abstract: Multi-instance multi-label learning (MIML) is a framework for learning in
  the presence of label ambiguity. In MIML, experts provide labels for groups of instances
  (bags), instead of directly providing a label for every instance. When labeling
  efforts are focused on a set of target classes, instances outside this set will
  not be appropriately modeled. For example, ornithologists label bird audio recordings
  with a list of species present. Other additional sound instances, e.g., a rain drop
  or a moving vehicle sound, are not labeled. The challenge is due to the fact that
  for a given bag, the presence or absence of novel instances is latent. In this paper,
  this problem is addressed using a discriminative probabilistic model that accounts
  for novel instances. We propose an exact and efficient implementation of the maximum
  likelihood approach to determine the model parameters and consequently learn an
  instance-level classifier for all classes including the novel class. Experiments
  on both synthetic and real datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
  approach.
