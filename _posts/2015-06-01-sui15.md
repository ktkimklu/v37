title: Safe Exploration for Optimization with Gaussian Processes
abstract: 'We consider sequential decision problems under uncertainty, where we seek
  to optimize an unknown function from noisy samples. This requires balancing exploration
  (learning about the objective) and exploitation (localizing the maximum), a problem
  well-studied in the multi-armed bandit literature. In many applications, however,
  we require that the sampled function values exceed some prespecified "safety" threshold,
  a requirement that existing algorithms fail to meet. Examples include medical applications
  where patient comfort must be guaranteed, recommender systems aiming to avoid user
  dissatisfaction, and robotic control, where one seeks to avoid controls causing
  physical harm to the platform. We tackle this novel, yet rich, set of problems under
  the assumption that the unknown function satisfies regularity conditions expressed
  via a Gaussian process prior. We develop an efficient algorithm called SafeOpt,
  and theoretically guarantee its convergence to a natural notion of optimum reachable
  under safety constraints. We evaluate SafeOpt on synthetic data, as well as two
  real applications: movie recommendation, and therapeutic spinal cord stimulation.'
