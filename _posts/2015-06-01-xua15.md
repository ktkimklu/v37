title: CUR Algorithm for Partially Observed Matrices
abstract: CUR matrix decomposition computes the low rank approximation of a given
  matrix by using the actual rows and columns of the matrix. It has been a very useful
  tool for handling large matrices. One limitation with the existing algorithms for
  CUR matrix decomposition is that they cannot deal with entries in a \it partially
  observed matrix, while incomplete matrices are found in many real world applications.
  In this work, we alleviate this limitation by developing a CUR decomposition algorithm
  for partially observed matrices. In particular, the proposed algorithm computes
  the low rank approximation of the target matrix based on (i) the randomly sampled
  rows and columns, and (ii) a subset of observed entries that are randomly sampled
  from the matrix. Our analysis shows the relative error bound, measured by spectral
  norm, for the proposed algorithm when the target matrix is of full rank. We also
  show that only O(n r\ln r) observed entries are needed by the proposed algorithm
  to perfectly recover a rank r matrix of size n\times n, which improves the sample
  complexity of the existing algorithms for matrix completion. Empirical studies on
  both synthetic and real-world datasets verify our theoretical claims and demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
