title: A Bayesian nonparametric procedure for comparing algorithms
abstract: A fundamental task in machine learning is to compare the performance of
  multiple algorithms. This is typically performed by frequentist tests (usually the
  Friedman test followed by a series of multiple pairwise comparisons). This implies
  dealing with null hypothesis significance tests and p-values, although the shortcomings
  of such methods are well known. First, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian version
  of the Friedman test using a Dirichlet process (DP) based prior. Our derivations
  show that, from a Bayesian perspective, the Friedman test is an inference for a
  multivariate mean based on an ellipsoid inclusion test. Second, we derive a joint
  procedure for the analysis of the multiple comparisons which accounts for their
  dependencies and which is based on the posterior probability computed through the
  DP. The proposed approach allows verifying the null hypothesis, not only rejecting
  it. Third, we apply our test to perform algorithms racing, i.e., the problem of
  identifying the best algorithm among a large set of candidates. We show by simulation
  that our approach is competitive both in terms of accuracy and speed in identifying
  the best algorithm.
