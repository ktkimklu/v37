title: Consistent estimation of dynamic and multi-layer block models
abstract: 'Significant progress has been made recently on theoretical analysis of
  estimators for the stochastic block model (SBM). In this paper, we consider the
  multi-graph SBM, which serves as a foundation for many application settings including
  dynamic and multi-layer networks. We explore the asymptotic properties of two estimators
  for the multi-graph SBM, namely spectral clustering and the maximum-likelihood estimate
  (MLE), as the number of layers of the multi-graph increases. We derive sufficient
  conditions for consistency of both estimators and propose a variational approximation
  to the MLE that is computationally feasible for large networks. We verify the sufficient
  conditions via simulation and demonstrate that they are practical. In addition,
  we apply the model to two real data sets: a dynamic social network and a multi-layer
  social network with several types of relations.'
