title: Fixed-point algorithms for learning determinantal point processes
abstract: 'Determinantal point processes (DPPs) offer an elegant tool for encoding
  probabilities over subsets of a ground set. Discrete DPPs are parametrized by a
  positive semidefinite matrix (called the DPP kernel), and estimating this kernel
  is key to learning DPPs from observed data. We consider the task of learning the
  DPP kernel, and develop for it a surprisingly simple yet effective new algorithm.
  Our algorithm offers the following benefits over previous approaches: (a) it is
  much simpler; (b) it yields equally good and sometimes even better local maxima;
  and (c) it runs an order of magnitude faster on large problems. We present experimental
  results on both real and simulated data to illustrate the numerical performance
  of our technique.'
