title: The Composition Theorem for Differential Privacy
abstract: 'Interactive querying of a database degrades the privacy level. In this
  paper we answer the fundamental question of characterizing the level of privacy
  degradation as a function of the number of adaptive interactions and the differential
  privacy levels maintained by the individual queries. Our solution is complete: the
  privacy degradation guarantee is true for every privacy mechanism, and further,
  we demonstrate a sequence of privacy mechanisms that do degrade in the characterized
  manner. The key innovation is the introduction of an operational interpretation
  (involving hypothesis testing) to differential privacy and the use of the corresponding
  data processing inequalities. Our result improves over the state of the art and
  has immediate applications to several problems studied in the literature.'
