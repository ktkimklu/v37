title: Non-Linear Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering via Hyper-Structure Transfer
abstract: The Cross Domain Collaborative Filtering (CDCF) exploits the rating matrices
  from multiple domains to make better recommendations. Existing CDCF methods adopt
  the sub-structure sharing technique that can only transfer linearly correlated knowledge
  between domains. In this paper, we propose the notion of Hyper-Structure Transfer
  (HST) that requires the rating matrices to be explained by the projections of some
  more complex structure, called the hyper-structure, shared by all domains, and thus
  allows the non-linearly correlated knowledge between domains to be identified and
  transferred. Extensive experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate the
  effectiveness of our HST models empirically.
