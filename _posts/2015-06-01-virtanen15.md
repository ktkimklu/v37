title: Ordinal Mixed Membership Models
abstract: We present a novel class of mixed membership models for joint distributions
  of groups of observations that co-occur with ordinal response variables for each
  group for learning statistical associations between the ordinal response variables
  and the observation groups. The class of proposed models addresses a requirement
  for predictive and diagnostic methods in a wide range of practical contemporary
  applications. In this work, by way of illustration, we apply the models to a collection
  of consumer-generated reviews of mobile software applications, where each review
  contains unstructured text data accompanied with an ordinal rating, and demonstrate
  that the models infer useful and meaningful recurring patterns of consumer feedback.
  We also compare the developed models to relevant existing works, which rely on improper
  statistical assumptions for ordinal variables, showing significant improvements
  both in predictive ability and knowledge extraction.
