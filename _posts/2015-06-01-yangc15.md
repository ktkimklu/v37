title: A Unified Framework for Outlier-Robust PCA-like Algorithms
abstract: 'We propose a unified framework for making a wide range of PCA-like algorithms
  – including the standard PCA, sparse PCA and non-negative sparse PCA, etc. – robust
  when facing a constant fraction of arbitrarily corrupted outliers. Our theoretic
  analysis establishes solid performance guarantees of the proposed framework: its
  estimation error is upper bounded by a term depending on the intrinsic parameters
  of the data model, the selected PCA-like algorithm and the fraction of outliers.
  Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
  the outlier-robust PCA-like algorithms derived from our framework have outstanding
  performance.'
