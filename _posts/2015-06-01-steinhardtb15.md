title: Learning Fast-Mixing Models for Structured Prediction
abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are often used for approximate
  inference inside learning, but their slow mixing can be difficult to diagnose and
  the resulting approximate gradients can seriously degrade learning. To alleviate
  these issues, we define a new model family using strong Doeblin Markov chains, whose
  mixing times can be precisely controlled by a parameter. We also develop an algorithm
  to learn such models, which involves maximizing the data likelihood under the induced
  stationary distribution of these chains. We show empirical improvements on two challenging
  inference tasks.
