title: The Kendall and Mallows Kernels for Permutations
abstract: We show that the widely used Kendall tau correlation coefficient is a positive
  definite kernel for permutations. It offers a computationally attractive alternative
  to more complex kernels on the symmetric group to learn from rankings, or to learn
  to rank. We show how to extend it to partial rankings or rankings with uncertainty,
  and demonstrate promising results on high-dimensional classification problems in
  biomedical applications.
