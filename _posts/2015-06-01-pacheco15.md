title: 'Proteins, Particles, and Pseudo-Max-Marginals: A Submodular Approach'
abstract: Variants of max-product (MP) belief propagation effectively find modes of
  many complex graphical models, but are limited to discrete distributions. Diverse
  particle max-product (D-PMP) robustly approximates max-product updates in continuous
  MRFs using stochastically sampled particles, but previous work was specialized to
  tree-structured models. Motivated by the challenging problem of protein side chain
  prediction, we extend D-PMP in several key ways to create a generic MAP inference
  algorithm for loopy models. We define a modified diverse particle selection objective
  that is provably submodular, leading to an efficient greedy algorithm with rigorous
  optimality guarantees, and corresponding max-marginal error bounds. We further incorporate
  tree-reweighted variants of the MP algorithm to allow provable verification of global
  MAP recovery in many models. Our general-purpose Matlab library is applicable to
  a wide range of pairwise graphical models, and we validate our approach using optical
  flow benchmarks. We further demonstrate superior side chain prediction accuracy
  compared to baseline algorithms from the state-of-the-art Rosetta package.
