title: Large-Scale Markov Decision Problems with KL Control Cost and its Application
  to Crowdsourcing
abstract: We study average and total cost Markov decision problems with large state
  spaces. Since the computational and statistical costs of finding the optimal policy
  scale with the size of the state space, we focus on searching for near-optimality
  in a low-dimensional family of policies. In particular, we show that for problems
  with a Kullback-Leibler divergence cost function, we can reduce policy optimization
  to a convex optimization and solve it approximately using a stochastic subgradient
  algorithm. We show that the performance of the resulting policy is close to the
  best in the low-dimensional family. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
  by controlling the important crowdsourcing application of budget allocation in crowd
  labeling.
