title: Message Passing for Collective Graphical Models
abstract: Collective graphical models (CGMs) are a formalism for inference and learning
  about a population of independent and identically distributed individuals when only
  noisy aggregate data are available. We highlight a close connection between approximate
  MAP inference in CGMs and marginal inference in standard graphical models. The connection
  leads us to derive a novel Belief Propagation (BP) style algorithm for collective
  graphical models. Mathematically, the algorithm is a strict generalization of BPâ€”it
  can be viewed as an extension to minimize the Bethe free energy plus additional
  energy terms that are non-linear functions of the marginals. For CGMs, the algorithm
  is much more efficient than previous approaches to inference. We demonstrate its
  performance on two synthetic experiments concerning bird migration and collective
  human mobility.
