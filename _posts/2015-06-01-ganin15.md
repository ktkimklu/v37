title: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation
abstract: Top-performing deep architectures are trained on massive amounts of labeled
  data. In the absence of labeled data for a certain task, domain adaptation often
  provides an attractive option given that labeled data of similar nature but from
  a different domain (e.g. synthetic images) are available. Here, we propose a new
  approach to domain adaptation in deep architectures that can be trained on large
  amount of labeled data from the source domain and large amount of unlabeled data
  from the target domain (no labeled target-domain data is necessary). As the training
  progresses, the approach promotes the emergence of "deep" features that are (i)
  discriminative for the main learning task on the source domain and (ii) invariant
  with respect to the shift between the domains. We show that this adaptation behaviour
  can be achieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard
  layers and a simple new gradient reversal layer. The resulting augmented architecture
  can be trained using standard backpropagation. Overall, the approach can be implemented
  with little effort using any of the deep-learning packages. The method performs
  very well in a series of image classification experiments, achieving adaptation
  effect in the presence of big domain shifts and outperforming previous state-of-the-art
  on Office datasets.
