title: 'PASSCoDe: Parallel ASynchronous Stochastic dual Co-ordinate Descent'
abstract: Stochastic Dual Coordinate Descent (DCD) is one of the most efficient ways
  to solve the family of L2-regularized empirical risk minimization problems, including
  linear SVM, logistic regression, and many others. The vanilla implementation of
  DCD is quite slow; however, by maintaining primal variables while updating dual
  variables, the time complexity of DCD can be significantly reduced. Such a strategy
  forms the core algorithm in the widely-used LIBLINEAR package. In this paper, we
  parallelize the DCD algorithms in LIBLINEAR. In recent research, several synchronized
  parallel DCD algorithms have been proposed, however, they fail to achieve good speedup
  in the shared memory multi-core setting. In this paper, we propose a family of parallel
  asynchronous stochastic dual coordinate descent algorithms (PASSCoDe). Each thread
  repeatedly selects a random dual variable and conducts coordinate updates using
  the primal variables that are stored in the shared memory. We analyze the convergence
  properties of DCD when different locking/atomic mechanisms are applied. For implementation
  with atomic operations, we show linear convergence under mild conditions. For implementation
  without any atomic operations or locking, we present a novel error analysis for
  PASSCoDe under the multi-core environment, showing that the converged solution is
  the exact solution for a primal problem with a perturbed regularizer. Experimental
  results show that our methods are much faster than previous parallel coordinate
  descent solvers.
