title: Risk and Regret of Hierarchical Bayesian Learners
abstract: 'Common statistical practice has shown that the full power of Bayesian methods
  is not realized until hierarchical priors are used, as these allow for greater “robustness”
  and the ability to “share statistical strength.” Yet it is an ongoing challenge
  to provide a learning-theoretically sound formalism of such notions that: offers
  practical guidance concerning when and how best to utilize hierarchical models;
  provides insights into what makes for a good hierarchical prior; and, when the form
  of the prior has been chosen, can guide the choice of hyperparameter settings. We
  present a set of analytical tools for understanding hierarchical priors in both
  the online and batch learning settings. We provide regret bounds under log-loss,
  which show how certain hierarchical models compare, in retrospect, to the best single
  model in the model class. We also show how to convert a Bayesian log-loss regret
  bound into a Bayesian risk bound for any bounded loss, a result which may be of
  independent interest. Risk and regret bounds for Student’s t and hierarchical Gaussian
  priors allow us to formalize the concepts of “robustness” and “sharing statistical
  strength.” Priors for feature selection are investigated as well. Our results suggest
  that the learning-theoretic benefits of using hierarchical priors can often come
  at little cost on practical problems.'
