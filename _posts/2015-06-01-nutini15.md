title: Coordinate Descent Converges Faster with the Gauss-Southwell Rule Than Random
  Selection
abstract: 'There has been significant recent work on the theory and application of
  randomized coordinate descent algorithms, beginning with the work of  Nesterov [SIAM
  J. Optim., 22(2), 2012], who showed that a random-coordinate selection rule achieves
  the same convergence rate as the Gauss-Southwell selection rule. This result suggests
  that we should never use the Gauss-Southwell rule, as it is typically much more
  expensive than random selection. However, the empirical behaviours of these algorithms
  contradict this theoretical result: in applications where the computational costs
  of the selection rules are comparable, the Gauss-Southwell selection rule tends
  to perform substantially better than random coordinate selection. We give a simple
  analysis of the Gauss-Southwell rule showing that—except in extreme cases—it’s convergence
  rate is faster than choosing random coordinates. Further, in this work we (i) show
  that exact coordinate optimization improves the convergence rate for certain sparse
  problems, (ii) propose a Gauss-Southwell-Lipschitz rule that gives an even faster
  convergence rate given knowledge of the Lipschitz constants of the partial derivatives,
  (iii) analyze the effect of approximate Gauss-Southwell rules, and (iv) analyze
  proximal-gradient variants of the Gauss-Southwell rule.'
